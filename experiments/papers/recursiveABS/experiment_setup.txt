grid-size:          according to _number in files (25, 15, 10)
similarity:         80%
density:            80%
red/green:          50%
movement:           Global
selection:          Random
opt. Retries:       1
freeCeel Retries:   4
RNG Seed:           42 (of course in all runs the same!!!)
Future optimizing:  Depending on experiment, see file if Future/Present

Conclusion so far:
Future-optimization seems not to be really better but can lead to much more unstable behaviour as seen in the 10x10 case where out of nothing suddenly the dynamics run wild
