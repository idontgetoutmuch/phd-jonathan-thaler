Stuff of my PhD I want to share publicly: all code, texts of my papers, research-notes &amp; research-diary

In my PhD in computer science at the University of Nottingham I am looking into computer aided formal verification of agent-based simulations and their implementation in pure functional languages like Haskell and Agda. As the field of application for the agent-based simulations / models I have chosen auction-processes because I am very interested in the dynamics of such. 
Note that I am fully rooted in computer science and am NOT an economist, thus this work will build on existing research in economics and will not aim to add new research to the field of economics but new insight for computational economics may be a by-product.

To give a short overview of the ideas and research directions the abstract of my Research Proposal is quoted here:

Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABM/S) is still a young discipline and the dominant approach to it is object-oriented computation. This thesis goes into the opposite direction and asks how ABM/S can be mapped to and implemented using pure functional computation and what one gains from doing so. To the best knowledge of the author, so far no proper treatment of ABM/S in this field exists but a few papers which only scratch the surface. The author argues that approaching ABM/S from a pure functional direction offers a wealth of new powerful tools and methods. The most obvious one is that when using pure functional computation reasoning about the correctness and about total and partial correctness of the simulation becomes possible. Also pure functional approaches allow the design of an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) in which then the models can be formulated by domain-experts. The strongest point in using EDSL is that ideally the distinction between specification and implementation disappears: the model specification is then already the code of the simulation-program. This allows to rule out a serious class of errors where specification and implementation does not match, which is especially a big problem in scientific computing. The application will be in the field of agent-based computational economics (ACE) where the primary goal will be to implement a pure functional framework with a suitable EDSL in Haskell. This will give computational economists a tool to formulate their models  in this EDSL and run them directly in Haskell.
