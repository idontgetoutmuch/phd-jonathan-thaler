Stuff of my PhD I want to share publicly: all code, texts of my papers, research-notes &amp; research-diary

In my PhD in computer science at the University of Nottingham I am looking into computer aided formal verification of agent-based simulations and their implementation in pure functional languages like Haskell and Agda. As the field of application for the agent-based simulations / models I have chosen auction-processes because I am very interested in the dynamics of such. 
Note that I am fully rooted in computer science and am NOT an economist, thus this work will build on existing research in economics and will not aim to add new research to the field of economics but new insight for computational economics may be a by-product.

To give a short overview of the ideas and research directions the abstract of my Research Proposal is quoted here:

Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABM/S) is still a young discipline and the dominant approach to it is object oriented computation. This thesis goes into the opposite direction and asks how ABM/S can be mapped to and implemented using pure functional computation and what one gains from doing so. To the best knowledge of the author, so far no proper treatment of ABM/S in pure functional computation exists but only a few papers which only scratch the surface. The author argues that approaching ABM/S from a pure functional direction  offers a wealth of new powerful tools and methods. The most obvious one is that when using pure functional computation (equational) resoning about the correctness and about total and partial correctness of the simulation becomes possible. The ultimate benefit is that Agda becomes applicable which is - according to the Curry-Howard isomorphism - both a pure functional programming language and a proof assistant for intuitionistic logic allowing both to compute the dynamics of the simulation and to look at meta-level properties of the simulation - termination, convergence, equilibria, domain specific properties - by constructing proofs utilizing computer aided verification. \\
The application will be in the field of agent-based computational economics where the main focus will be on simulating the dynamics of equilibrium in bilateral trading. This is a quite new and ongoing research in economics and very strongly driven by simulative approaches and still a very open question among economists how prices reach equilibrium over time.
