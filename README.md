Stuff of my PhD I want to share publicly: all code, texts of my papers, research-notes &amp; research-diary

In my PhD in computer science at the University of Nottingham I am looking into computer aided formal verification of agent-based simulations and their implementation in pure functional languages like Haskell and Agda.
As the field of application for the agent-based simulations / models I have chosen auction-processes because I am very interested in the dynamics of such. Note that I am fully rooted in computer science and am NOT an economist, thus this work will build on existing research in economics but will not aim to add new research to the field of economics. Maybe new insight for computational economics will be the result.
