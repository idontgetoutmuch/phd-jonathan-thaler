\section*{Publications}
Throughout the course of the Ph.D. six (6) papers with myself as the main author and contributor were written and submitted. Four (4) were accepted, one (1) remains work in progress and one (1) is pending:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{The Art of Iterating - Update Strategies in Agent-Based Simulation} \cite{payne_social_2019, thaler_art_2017}, submitted and accepted at the Social Simulation Conference 2017. This paper derives four different update strategies and their properties possible in time and event-driven ABS and discusses them from a programming paradigm agnostic point of view. It is the first paper which makes the very basics of update semantics clear on a conceptual level and is necessary to understand the options one has when implementing time- and event-driven ABS purely functional.
	
	\item \textit{Pure Functional Epidemics} \cite{thaler_pure_2018}, submitted and accepted at the IFL Conference 2018. Using an agent-based SIR model, this paper establishes in technical detail \textit{how} to implement time-driven ABS in Haskell using non-monadic Functional Reactive Programming with Yampa and monadic Functional Reactive Programming with Dunai. This paper outlines benefits and drawbacks of the above and also touches on important points for this thesis which were out of scope and edited out due to lack of space in the initial paper. However, these salient points on the topic of time-driven ABS will be addressed in more detail in this thesis.

	\item \textit{Show Me Your Properties! The Potential of Property-Based Testing in Agent-Based Simulation} \cite{thaler_show_2019}, submitted and accepted at the Summer Simulation Conference 2019. This paper introduces property-based testing, on a conceptual level to ABS, using the agent-based SIR model and the Sugarscape model as two case studies. It shows how to encode specifications of explanatory models into properties and test individual agent behaviour and emergent properties of exploratory models.
	
	\item \textit{A Tale of Lock-Free Agents: Towards Software Transactional Memory in parallel Agent-Based Simulation} \cite{thaler_tale_2018}, published in the Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling Journal. This paper is the first to discuss the use of Software Transactional Memory for implementing concurrent ABS both on a conceptual and on a technical level. It presents two case studies, with the agent-based SIR model as the first case study and the Sugarscape model as the second being the second. Both case studies compare the performance of Software Transactional Memory and lock-based implementations in Haskell. Although Software Transactional Memory is now not unique to Haskell anymore, this paper shows why Haskell is particularly well suited for the use of Software Transactional Memory and is the only language which can overcome the central problem of how to prevent persistent side effects in retry semantics.

	\item \textit{Specification Testing of Agent-Based Simulation using Property-Based Testing.} \cite{thaler_specification_2019}, submitted to the JAAMAS Journal in August 2019 is currently under review.
This paper introduces property-based testing on a technical level to ABS using the agent-based SIR model model as case study. It builds on the previous conceptual paper and discusses the topic in much more technical detail and also shows the use of statistically robust hypothesis testing with property-based testing.
	
	\item \textit{The Agents' New Clothes? Towards Pure Functional Agent-Based Simulation} \cite{thaler_agents_2019}, submitted to the Summer Simulation Conference 2019. This paper summarizes the main benefits of using pure functional programming with Haskell to implement ABS and discusses, on a conceptual level, how to implement it and also what potential drawbacks are and where the use of a functional approach is not encouraged. It is written as a conceptual review paper, which tries to 'sell' pure functional programming to the agent-based community without too much technical detail and parlance where it refers to the important technical literature from where an interested reader can start.
