\section{Using the Type-System}
Static type system eliminates a large number run-time bugs.

\section{Reasoning}
TODO: can we apply equational reasoning? Can we (informally) reason about various properties e.g. termination?

\section{Unit-Testing}
Follow unit-testing of the whole simulation as prototyped for towards paper.

\section{Property-Based Testing}
Follow property-based testing as prototyped for towards paper.
