\chapter{Verification \& Correctness}
Exploring ways in which pure functional ABS can be of benefit to verification \& validation and increasing correctness of an ABS implementation. Follow property-based testing as prototyped for towards paper, static type system eliminates a large number run-time bugs: if we decide to rule out IO then we can guarantee, TODO: can we apply equational reasoning? TODO: can we (informally) reason about various properties e.g. termination?
