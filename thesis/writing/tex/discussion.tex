In this part an in-depth, highly critical evaluation of the aim, objective and hypotheses of the introduction follows, which puts the techniques and contributions of this thesis into perspective.

Further it presents "Gintis case", which tries to answer the question whether functional programming would have avoided mistakes made by H. Gintis in his agent-based simulation. This question is quite important as it puts our initial claims that functional programming leads to code which is more likely to be correct to a test. 

We also return to the question whether objects map naturally to objects and give an extensive answer in the light of this thesis.

This part finishes with a brief conclusion to the thesis were also further research is discussed.
