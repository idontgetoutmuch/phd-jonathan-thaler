\chapter{Parallel ABS}
\label{ch:parallel_abs}

Establish how concurrency and parallelism can be made easily available in ABS using pure functional programming. Mostly follow STM paper and add pure parallelism in ABS. Make clear that Haskell allows to distinguish between pure, deterministic parallelism and impure, non-deterministic concurrency.

Also discuss where there is potential for adding parallelism: using data-parallel data-structures for the environment so cells can be updated in parallel, in time-driven ABS agents can be updated in parallel using parMap because they all act conceptually at the same time (and if they don't run in monadic code). 0\% finished.

we can implement everything except synchronous direct agent-interactions atm: if agent-interaction is one-way e.g. paying back a loan then this is no problem. thus the following parts of the Sugarscape are not possible with our current STM approach: mating, trading and lending  because all 3 require direct agent-to-agent interaction over multiple steps. We leave the problem of developing such an algorithm / implementation for further research.

use the STM paper but provide more haskell code
