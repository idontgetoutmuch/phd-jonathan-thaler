\chapter{Parallel ABS}
\label{ch:parallel_abs}

Establish how concurrency and parallelism can be made easily available in ABS using pure functional programming. Mostly follow STM paper and add pure parallelism in ABS. Make clear that Haskell allows to distinguish between pure, deterministic parallelism and impure, non-deterministic concurrency.

\section{Data-Parallelism}
Discusses where there is potential for adding parallelism: using data-parallel data-structures for the environment so cells can be updated in parallel, in time-driven ABS agents can be updated in parallel using parMap because they all act conceptually at the same time (and if they don't run in monadic code). 0\% finished.
