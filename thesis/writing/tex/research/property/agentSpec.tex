\chapter{Testing Agent Specifications}
\label{ch:agentspec}

In this chapter we show how to use QuickCheck to encode full agent specifications directly in code as property tests of both time and event-driven implementations of the agent-based SIR model. These properties serve as formal specification and tests at the same time, which is a fundamental strength of property-based testing that is not possible with unit testing in such a strong and expressive form. Aside from the high expressivity, QuickCheck also allows us to state statistical coverage for certain cases, which allows us to express statistical properties of the agents' behaviour, something that is also not directly possible with unit testing. This is a very strong indication that property-based testing is a natural fit for testing ABS.

\section{Discussion}
In this chapter we have shown how to express the specifications of both the event and time-driven agent behaviour directly in code as properties and how to implement property tests in QuickCheck for them. The approach to event-driven properties was to establish a correspondence between an input event, the current agent state, and the output events, and the new agents' state. In the case of the time-driven agent, the properties are expressed in terms of a potentially infinite stream of agent output states. Although both implementations follow the same underlying model, the technical details of the properties differ substantially. The reason for this is that although property-based testing is a black-box verification technique, the implementation often requires substantial knowledge of the internal details as can be seen especially in the event-driven case.

The resulting properties are highly expressive due to pattern matching and declarative programming and can be regarded as a kind of formal specification. Together with the properties, which check the state transition probabilities, we claim that the property tests shown in this chapter fully specify both the event and time-driven agent behaviour. This is a first example emphasising the usefulness of QuickCheck for testing ABS, providing a first strong evidence for the hypothesis that randomised property testing is a good match for testing ABS.

Curiously, the implementations of all the specifications and property tests have substantially more lines of code than the original implementations. However, this is not relevant here. We showed how to implement a full specification of an ABS model as a property test and we succeeded! This is definitely a strong indication that our hypothesis that randomised property-based testing is a suitable tool for testing ABS is valid. With unit tests we would be quite lost here, as even for the SIR model, it is hard to enumerate all possible interactions and cases. But, by stating invariants as properties and generating random test cases we make sure they are checked.

We have not looked into more complex testing patterns like the synchronous agent interactions of Sugarscape. We didn't look into testing full agent and interacting agent behaviour using property tests as its complexity would justify a thesis on its own. Due to its inherent stateful nature, with complex dependencies between valid states and agents' actions we need a more sophisticated approach. A possible direction would be the one as outlined in \cite{de_vries_quickcheckstatemachine}, where the authors show how to build a meta model and commands, which allow for specifying properties and valid state transitions that can be generated automatically. We leave this for further research.

By exploiting lazy evaluation in the time-driven tests, we scratch on what is conveniently possible in established approaches to ABS. We can let the simulation run potentially forever as in the case of the infected agent and rely on the correctness of the implementation to terminate in finite steps when consuming the potentially infinite stream.

We did not include an explicit environment in our agent specification tests and assumed a fully connected network where all agents can contact each other. We claim that property-based testing is highly useful there as well, especially when dealing with random environments like in Sugarscape or social and random networks \cite{easley_networks_2010,jackson_social_2008}. We leave this for further research, but we hypothesise that for the SIR model all properties presented here should still hold under different environments.
