\section{Case Studies}
In this section we go into a little more detail as to how to apply the parallelism concepts that were already outlined above to our use cases from Chapters \ref{sec:timedriven_firststep}, \ref{sec:adding_env} and Sugarscape. All timings are rough averages over multiple runs and not precise measurements because that is not the point here. We are only interested in showing what rough potential there is for speeding up computation through deterministic parallelism. Again, we are not interested in high-performance computation here, but rather in conceptual comparisons between sequential and parallel implementations.
