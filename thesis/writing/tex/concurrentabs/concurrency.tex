\section{Concurrency}
This section is a quite extensive one, due to the much complexer nature of the topic. In this chapter we focus on the use of Software Transactional Memory (STM) to implement concurrent ABS in Haskell. There exist mechanisms for traditional lock-based concurrency in Haskell as well, but even though due to Haskells type system and pure functional nature, we would still suffer similar problems, imperative solutions suffer. Thus we focus on the unique way Haskell implements and enables STM and show that it is indeed a very powerful abstraction to implement concurrent ABS. Note that STM is by now available in imperative oop languages as well, but we will show that it is only in Haskell with its type system where it really shines and can guarantee its semantics.
