The authors of \cite{botta_time_2010} discuss the problem of advancing time in message-driven agent-based socio-economic models. They formulate purely functional definitions for agents and their interactions through messages. Our architecture for synchronous agent-interaction as discussed in Chapter TODO was not directly inspired by their work but has some similarities: the use of messages and the problem of when to advance time in models with arbitrary number synchronised agent-interactions.
