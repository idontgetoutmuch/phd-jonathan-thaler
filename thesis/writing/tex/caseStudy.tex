\section{Case-Study}
perform gintis case-study: apply my developed techniques of implementing ABS and testing and concurrency / parallelism to the gintis paper (and its follow ups: the ionescu paper and the masterthesis on it). 
The aim of this is to see: 

1. do the techniques transfer to this problem? 
2. does haskell prevent making that mistake which gintis made? 
3. how close is our implementation to ionescus functional specification? 
4. validation and verification against gintis paper using property-based testing of individual agents and the simulation as a whole. 
5. being more familiar with dependent types, would they help and where do they fit in in combination with the ionescu functional specification, which mentions dependent types at the end.
