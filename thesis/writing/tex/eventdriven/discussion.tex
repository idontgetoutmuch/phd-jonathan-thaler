\section{Discussion}
Although there are similarities to the work of \cite{botta_time_2010} (the use of messages and the problem of when to advance time in models with arbitrary number synchronised agent-interactions), we approach our agents differently. First in our approach an agent is only a single MSF and thus can not be directly queried for its internal state / its id or outgoing messages, instead of taking a list of messages, our agents take a single event/message and can produce an arbitrary number of outgoing messages together with an observable state - note that this would allow to query the agent for its id and its state as well by simply sending a corresponding message to the agents MSF and requiring the agent to implement message handling for it. Also the state of our agents is \textit{completely} localised and there is no means of accessing the state from outside the agent, they are thus "fully encapsulated agents" \cite{botta_time_2010}. Note that the authors of \cite{botta_time_2010} define their agents with a polymorphic agent-state type \textit{s}, which implies that without knowledge of the specific type of \textit{s} there would be no way of accessing the state, rendering it in fact also fully encapsulated. The problem of advancing time in our approach is solved not exactly the same but conceptually it is the same: after sending a tick message to each agent (in random order), we process all agents until they are idle: there are no more enqueued messages / events in the queue.

our eventdriven approach makes heavy use of 2 state monads, thus one might ask what the benefits are, after all we seem to fall back into stateful, imperative style programming. we agree that our approach is just one way of implementing abs in fp but we think we have come a long way thus making our approach quite valuable even if there might be other approaches like shallow EDSLs. on the other hand even our stateful programming is highly restricted to only those 2 local datatypes which makes it much more manageable than unrestricted data mutation
further in our monad stack we control the operations possible to the respective layers: e.g. sending messages/events is a write-only operation (as it should be), accessing the unique agent-id and the model-configuration is read-only (as it should be) - all guaranteed at compile-time

quote carmack (\url{http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/169296/Indepth_Functional_programming_in_C.php}): the main difficulty as a developer in software programming is to keep track of the states a program can be in and reason about them and their Validity

TODO: report LoC and compare it with other implementations we found on the internet
