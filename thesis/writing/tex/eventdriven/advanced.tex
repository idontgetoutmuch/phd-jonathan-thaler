\section{Advanced features of event-driven ABS}
In this section we introduce advanced features of event-driven ABS, not possible using the time-driven update-strategy, using the Sugarscape model. The advanced features are the dynamic creation and removal of agents during the simulation, a mutable shared environment, local mutable agent state and most important, synchronous direct agent interactions.

It is important to emphasise that only the semantics of the sequential update-strategy allow this kind of features as the agents act one after the other, seeing the effects of previous agents in the same time-step. This would not make sense in the parallel update-strategy, where agents act conceptually at the same time - event-driven ABS is inherently sequential due to its fundamental reliance on effects as will become clearer in the steps developed below.
