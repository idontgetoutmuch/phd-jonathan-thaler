\chapter{Pure Functional Event-Driven ABS}
\label{ch:eventdriven}

In this chapter we build on the previous discussion of update-strategies in Chapter \ref{ch:impl_abs} and the implementation techniques presented in the time-driven approach of Chapter \ref{ch:timedriven} to develop concepts for event-driven ABS in a pure functional way. 

In event-driven ABS \cite{meyer_event-driven_2014}, the simulation is advanced through events: agents and the environment schedule events into the future and react to incoming events scheduled by themselves, other agents, the environment or the simulation kernel. Time is discrete in this approach: it advances step-wise from event to event, where each event has an associated time-stamp, indicating the virtual simulation time when it is scheduled. This implies that time could stay constant e.g. when an event is scheduled with a time-delay of 0 the virtual simulation time does not advance. Because agents can adopt and change their state and behaviour when processing an event, this means that even if time does not advance, agents can change. This non-signal behaviour is the fundamental difference to the time-driven approach in Chapter \ref{ch:timedriven}. Further, we exploit this mechanism to implement direct agent-interactions pure functionally as discussed in the implementation discussion below.

The event-driven approach makes the simulation kernel technically closely related to a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) \cite{zeigler_theory_2000}. Due to the necessity of imposing a correct ordering of events in this type of ABS, we need to step it event by event, with the \textit{sequential} update-strategy, as introduced in Chapter \ref{sec:seq_strategy}, being the only feasible one for this type of ABS. Note that there exists also Parallel DES (PDES) \cite{fujimoto_parallel_1990}, which processes events in parallel and deals with inconsistencies by reverting to consistent states - we hypothesize that a pure functional approach could be beneficial in such an approach due to persistent data-structures and explicit handling of side-effects but we leave this for further research.

\medskip

First we start using an event-driven agent-based SIR model, inspired by \cite{macal_agent-based_2010} to introduce the concepts of agent identity and also event scheduling utilising both \textit{Reader} and \textit{Writer} Monads which we then generalise to a \textit{tagless final} approach. Note that in event-driven ABS, due to the fact that agents are not signals any more, we abandon time-aware signal functions from the previous chapter and focus solely on Monadic Stream Functions (MSFs).

We then use the highly complex Sugarscape model as introduced in Chapter \ref{sec:sugarscape}, to develop more advanced features of ABS in a pure functional context: dynamic creation and removal of agents during simulation, reading/writing from a shared mutable environment, local mutable agent state and synchronised direct agent-interactions. 
Note that the Sugarscape model is not a real event-driven model like the event-driven SIR one is: in it the agents do schedule events but they don't do this into the future - events in Sugarscape don't have associated time-stamps.
