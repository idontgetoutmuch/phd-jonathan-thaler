\chapter{Pure Functional Event-Driven ABS}
\label{ch:eventdriven}

In this chapter we build on the previous discussion of update-strategies in Chapter \ref{ch:impl_abs} and the implementation techniques presented in the time-driven approach of Chapter \ref{ch:timedriven} to develop concepts for event-driven ABS in a pure functional way. 

In event-driven ABS \cite{meyer_event-driven_2014}, the simulation is advanced through events: agents and the environment schedule events into the future and react to incoming events scheduled by themselves, other agents, the environment or the simulation kernel. Time is discrete in this approach: it advances step-wise from event to event where each event has an accociated time-stamp which indicates the virtual simulation time when it is scheduled. This implies that time could stay constant e.g. when an event is scheduled with a time-delay of 0 the virtual simulation time does not advance. Because agents can adopt and change their state and behaviour when processing an event this means that even if time does not advance, agents can change. This non-signal behaviour is the fundamental difference to the time-driven approach in Chapter \ref{ch:timedriven}. Further, we exploit this mechanism to implement direct agent-interactions in pure functional ABS as discussed in our use-case of the Sugarscape model.

The event-driven approach makes the simulation kernel technically quite close to a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) \cite{zeigler_theory_2000}. Due to the necessity of imposing a correct ordering of events in this type of ABS, we are forced to step it event by event, with the \textit{sequential} update-strategy. Note that there exists also Parallel DES (PDES) \cite{fujimoto_parallel_1990}, which processes events in parallel and deals with inconsistencies by reverting to consistent states - we hypothesize that a pure functional approach could be beneficial due to persistent data-structures and explicit handling of side-effects but we leave this for further research.

We use the Sugarscape model to develop pure functional concepts for event-driven ABS \footnote{The code of all steps can be accessed freely through the following URL: \url{https://github.com/thalerjonathan/phd/tree/master/public/towards/SugarScape/sequential}}. We chose this model for the following reasons: it is quite well known in the ABS community; it was highly influential in sparking the interest in ABS; it is quite complex with non-trivial agent-interactions; the original implementation used object-oriented techniques (Objective C) and explicitly advocates them as a good fit to ABS which begged the question whether and how well a pure functional implementation is possible. The Sugarscape model is not a classic event-driven model as in it the agents do schedule events they don't do this into the future - events in Sugarscape don't have associated time-stamps. Still the underlying concepts are the same as in event-driven ABS and it is trivial to add time-stamps, moving towards a real event-driven ABS with DES character.

% direct MSF call, Problem is recursive nature. maybe try it with gintis Implementation. I just learned that what i want to achieve is actually: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_(computer_programming)#Open_recursion AND OPEN RECURSION IS PRETTY BAD
