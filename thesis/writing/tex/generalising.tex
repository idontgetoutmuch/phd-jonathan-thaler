\chapter{Generalising}
TODO: this is still research which needs to be done by reading the papers below and reflecting  and understanding on co-monads and my implementations in general.

TODO: can we derive an agent-monad?

TODO: what about comonads? read essence dataflow paper \cite{uustalu_essence_2006}: monads not capable of stream-based programming and arrows too general therefor comonads, we are using msfs for abs therefore streambased so maybe applicable to our approach/agents=comonads. comonads structure notions of context-dependent computation or streams, which ABS can be seen as of. this paper says that monads are not capable of doing stream functions, maybe this is the reason why i fail in my attempt of defining an ABS in idris because i always tried to implement a monad family. TODO: stopped at comonad section, continue from there. TODO understand comonads: https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/edwardk/cellular-automata and https://kukuruku.co/post/cellular-automata-using-comonads/

independent of time-driven or event-driven, our agents are MSFs.
