TODO REFINE
- don't use resize population and always use normal size to be consistent and feed random population as random parameter
- use TimeRange and UnitRange consistently everywhere
- WORDING: don't use replications in terms of QuickCheck! we test properties with random test-cases
- IMPROVE EXPLANATION: more explanations, its too flat, code straight in the face, prepare it gently as it is not directly clear what the intention is. discuss it more generally, otherwise it reads like an advanced technical report and not like a thesis.
- explain more how and why and when we use cover and checkCoverage. Also when using cover we cannot use random model parameters as it changes distributions
- only use cover with/without checkCoverage instead of maxFailPercent => rework sugarscape hypotheses chapter; need not much change only remove maxFailPercent and use cover and run all cases again.
