\chapter{Property-Based Testing in ABS}
\label{ch:property}

In this chapter we present another reason \textit{why} pure functional ABS is of benefit: we can make direct use of property-based testing. This topic falls into the category of verification \& validation and is of fundamental importance to ABS. We first will introduce the problem of verification \& validation (V\&V) of an ABS implementation in general where we very briefly discuss ways in which pure functional ABS can be of benefit. Then we present property-based testing and how it can be applied to explanatory models, in the case of the agent-based SIR model and to exploratory models, in the case of the Sugarscape model.
