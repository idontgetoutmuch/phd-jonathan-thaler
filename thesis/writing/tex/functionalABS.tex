\chapter{Pure Functional ABS}
"how can we do ABS in functional programming?" art of iterating paper for basic foundations, conceptual paper for a high level description, pure functional epidemics for more details, then sugarscape "towards" paper for advanced and synchronised agent-interaction

Although there are similarities to the work of \cite{botta_time_2010} (the use of messages and the problem of when to advance time in models with arbitrary number synchronised agent-interactions), we approach our agents differently. First in our approach an agent is only a single MSF and thus can not be directly queried for its internal state / its id or outgoing messages, instead of taking a list of messages, our agents take a single event/message and can produce an arbitrary number of outgoing messages together with an observable state - note that this would allow to query the agent for its id and its state as well by simply sending a corresponding message to the agents MSF and requiring the agent to implement message handling for it. Also the state of our agents is \textit{completely} localised and there is no means of accessing the state from outside the agent, they are thus "fully encapsulated agents" \cite{botta_time_2010}. Note that the authors of \cite{botta_time_2010} define their agents with a polymorphic agent-state type \textit{s}, which implies that without knowledge of the specific type of \textit{s} there would be no way of accessing the state, rendering it in fact also fully encapsulated. The problem of advancing time in our approach is solved not exactly the same but conceptually it is the same: after sending a tick message to each agent (in random order), we process all agents until they are idle: there are no more enqueued messages / events in the queue.
