\chapter{Dependent Types}
dependent types will be put to rest unless there is really some time left (which i doubt) and will be considered in the final thesis but only on a conceptual level without going into lot of technical detail because: 1. i didn't do enough research on it and 2. dependent types seem to be nearly out of focus of the thesis. Dependent Types sections will be written very late, after the finished research has been incorporated, and if at that point i have come to the conclusion that it is too unfinished / vague / not substantial enough then i will simply skip this part (or if it is too long already and the contribution is enough already without dependent types).
