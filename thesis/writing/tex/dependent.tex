\chapter{Dependent Types}
%My work is all nice and good but it solves problems the ABS community and implementations never really had. My FRP/MSF approach is quite complex and can be equally difficult to get right. Even worse, the bugs were not primarily those I am solving with FP but the REAL problem in ABS is translating the model into code. Can FP help us here? Can my pure FP approach help here? expressing invariants in FP code? can we express them in types? 

The pure functional implementation techniques have a number of technical benefits but don't help as much in closing the gap between specification and implementation as one is used from functional programming in general. Therefore we take a step back and abstract from these highly complex implementation techniques and move towards dependent types. Follow \cite{botta_time_2010} and \cite{botta_functional_2011}.

Conceptually discuss how dependent types can be made of use in ABS without going into lot of technical detail because: 1. i didn't do enough research on it and 2. dependent types seem to be nearly out of focus of the thesis.
