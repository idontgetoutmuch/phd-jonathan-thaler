\section{STM in ABS}
\label{sec:stm_abs}
In this section we give a short overview of how we apply STM in our ABS. In both case-studies we fundamentally follow a time-driven, parallel approach as introduced in Chapter \ref{sub:par_strategy}, where the simulation is advanced by a given $\Delta t$ and in each step all agents are executed. To employ parallelism, each agent runs within its own thread and agents are executed in lock-step, synchronising between each $\Delta t$, which is controlled by the main thread. See Figure \ref{fig:stm_abs_structure} for a visualisation of our concurrent, time-driven lock-step approach.

By running each agent in a thread will guarantee the execution in parallel even if the agent has a monadic context. This is forces us to evaluate each agents monadic context separately instead of running them all in a common context. Note that ultimately we are ending up in the \textit{IO} context because \textit{STM} can be only transacted from within an \textit{IO} context due to non-deterministic side-effects. This is no contradiction to our original claim: yes we are running in IO but not the agent behaviour itself, which is a fundamental difference.

An agent thread will block until the main-thread sends the next $\Delta t$ and runs the \textit{STM} action atomically with the given $\Delta t$. When the \textit{STM} action has been committed, the thread will send the output of the agent action to the main-thread to signal it has finished. The main thread awaits the results of all agents to collect them for output of the current step e.g. visualisation or writing to a file.

As will be described in subsequent sections, central to both case-studies is an environment which is shared between the agents using a \textit{TVar} or \textit{TArray} primitive through which the agents communicate concurrently with each other. To get the environment in each step for visualisation purposes, the main thread can access the \textit{TVar} and \textit{TArray} as well.

\subsection{Adding and running the STM Monad}
We briefly show how to add STM to agents and run them within their own threads. We use the SIR implementation as example - applying it to the Sugarscape implementation works exactly the same way and is left as a trivial exercise to the reader.

The first step is to simply add the \textit{STM} to the existing transformer stack as the innermost monad. Note that it can only be the \textit{innermost} one as \textit{STM} does not provide a transformer implementation. This is for the same reason \textit{IO} needs to be the innermost monad: impure actions have to come last as otherwise pure values would depend on impure values. Further, \textit{IO} can only be evaluated within the surrounding \textit{IO} context, originating from main.

TODO: discuss the ordering of execution in a transformer stack and make it clear that STM comes last when and because it is the inner most

  dt <- takeMVar dtVar

  -- compute output of current step
  let sfReader = unMSF sf ()
      sfRand   = runReaderT sfReader dt
      sfSTM    = runRandT sfRand rng
  ((ret, sf'), rng') <- atomically sfSTM -- run the STM action atomically within IO

  -- post result to main thread

  -- to next step

  -- tell all threads to continue with the corresponding DTime
