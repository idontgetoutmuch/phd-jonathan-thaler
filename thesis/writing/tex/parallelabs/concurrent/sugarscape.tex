\section{Case-Study II: Sugarscape}
TODO: 
we can implement everything except synchronous direct agent-interactions atm: if agent-interaction is one-way e.g. paying back a loan then this is no problem. thus the following parts of the Sugarscape are not possible with our current STM approach: mating, trading and lending  because all 3 require direct agent-to-agent interaction over multiple steps. We leave the problem of developing such an algorithm / implementation for further research.
