\section{Case studies}
In this section we go a little bit more into detail how to apply the parallelism concepts as already outline above to our use cases from Chapters \ref{sec:timedriven_firststep}, \ref{sec:adding_env} and Sugarscape. All timings are rough averages over multiple runs and not precise measurements because that is not the point here. We are only interested in showing what rough potential there is for speeding up computation through deterministic parallelism. Again, we are not interested in high-performance computation here but rather in conceptual comparisons between sequential and parallel implementations.
