\section{Parallelism}
This section is rather short because there is not too much to say about it in the context of ABS. 

Also discuss where there is potential for adding parallelism: using data-parallel data-structures for the environment so cells can be updated in parallel, in time-driven ABS agents can be updated in parallel using parMap because they all act conceptually at the same time (and if they don't run in monadic code).
