\section{Parallelism in ABS}
The promise of parallelism in Haskell is compelling: speeding up the execution but retaining all static compile-time guarantees about determinism. In other words, using parallelism could give us a substantial performance improvement without sacrificing the static guarantees of reproducible outputs from repeated runs with initial conditions.

Generally, parallelism can be applied whenever the execution of code is order-independent, that is referential transparent, and has no implicit or explicit side-effects. In this section we introduce the two most important parallelism concepts of Haskell, \textit{evaluation} and \textit{data-flow} parallelism, and discuss their potential use in pure functional ABS in general. We follow \cite{marlow_parallel_2013} and refer to it for an in-depth discussion. Further, we show how these concepts can be added to our previously discussed use-cases of Chapters \ref{sec:timedriven_firststep}, \ref{sec:adding_env} and Sugarscape \ref{sec:eventdriven_implementation} and compare their performance over the original sequential approaches.

% IGNORE FOR NOW
%\subsection{Data-structure parallelism}
%An environment could be organised and accessed through such a data-structure, which could potentially lead to big speed ups. Agents could locally read the data-structure data-parallel and the simulation kernel could feed the output of the agents data-parallel back into this structure.

%general solution we opt for is  to run agents in parallel in our approaches. in other abs models we could apply data-structure parallelism and/or data-flow parallelism with huge Performance potential but thats always highly model dependent thus we dont go in depth here
