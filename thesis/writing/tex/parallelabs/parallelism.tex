\section{Parallelism in ABS}
The promise of parallelism is compelling: speeding up the execution but retaining all static compile-time guarantees about determinism. In other words, using parallelism could give us a substantial performance improvement without sacrificing the static guarantees of reproducible outputs from repeated runs.

Generally, parallelism can be applied whenever the execution of code is order-independent, that is, referential transparent and has no implicit or explicit side-effects. We follow the book \cite{marlow_parallel_2013}, which can be seen as the main authority for parallelism and concurrency in Haskell and refer to it for an in-depth discussions of parallel Haskell. From this reference, we can derive the following potential directions for parallelism in ABS:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Parallel map} - can be used without any second thoughts wherever \textit{map} is encountered. This can be on a very local scale within an agent, like mapping a simple function, or it can be global like executing the agents through map where much more work will be done in parallel due to the higher complexity of an agent function. Note that the latter one is only possible in non-monadic code.
	
	\item \textit{Data-parallel data-structures} - an environment could be organised and accessed through such a data-structure, which could potentially lead to big speed ups. Agents could locally read the data-structure data-parallel and the simulation kernel could feed the output of the agents data-parallel back into this structure.
	
	\item Par Monad: what for? not possible in yampa, but in dunai?
\end{itemize}

We keep this section rather short and exemplary and only try to apply the outlined parallelism techniques directly to our existing implementations and measure the speed-up.
