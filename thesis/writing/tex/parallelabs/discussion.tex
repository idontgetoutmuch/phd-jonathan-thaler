\section{Discussion}
Further research: implementing synchronous agent-interactions in a concurrent implementation with STM, the approach of executing dependent functions in different layers \url{https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/11/3/334/225993} might allow even further speed-up, also the same paper: "Mobile discrete simulations consisting of agents navigating a grid like environment are less well-suited to a GPU implementation as they are traditionally implemented in sequential environments. Parallel implementations of discrete mobile systems on the GPU must explicitly handle collision conditions which result from agents simultaneously moving to the same discrete location."

we can implement everything except synchronous direct agent-interactions atm: if agent-interaction is one-way e.g. paying back a loan then this is no problem. thus the following parts of the Sugarscape are not possible with our current STM approach: mating, trading and lending  because all 3 require direct agent-to-agent interaction over multiple steps. We leave the problem of developing such an algorithm / implementation for further research.
