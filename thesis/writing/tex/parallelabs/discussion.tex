\chapter*{Discussion}
Further research: implementing synchronous agent-interactions in a concurrent implementation with STM, the approach of executing dependent functions in different layers \url{https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/11/3/334/225993} might allow even further speed-up, also the same paper: "Mobile discrete simulations consisting of agents navigating a grid like environment are less well-suited to a GPU implementation as they are traditionally implemented in sequential environments. Parallel implementations of discrete mobile systems on the GPU must explicitly handle collision conditions which result from agents simultaneously moving to the same discrete location."
