\begin{appendices}
Datasets, lengthy code, additional proofs.

\chapter{System Dynamics}
discuss pure functional system dynamics - correct by construction

\chapter{Discrete Event Simulation}
pure functional DES easily possible with my developed synchronous messaging ABS, come up with a small prototype: bank example

PDES, should be  conceptually easil possible using STM, but need to come up with a small prototype

\chapter{Recursive Simulation}
add ideas about recursive simulation described in 1st year report and "paper". functional programming maps naturally here due to its inherently recursive nature and controlled side-effects which makes it easier to construct correct recursive simulations.
