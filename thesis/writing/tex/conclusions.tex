This chapter concludes the whole thesis and outlines future research. Roughly 20\% exists already.

%we now know how to engineer time- and event-driven ABS with complex state both in the agent and environment, main difficulty is direct agent-interaction (see macal classification into 4 types of ABS), compile-time guaranteed reproducibility, explicit handling of complex state (read only, read/write), concurrency explicit and limited to STM, very promising concurrency but direct agent-interactions main problem (erlang as a rescue?), main drawbacks: everything is explicit, performance

\section{Further Research}
1. generalise concepts explored into a pure functional ABS library in Haskell (called chimera),
2. dependent types and linear types are the next big step, towards a stronger formalisation of agents and ABS,
3. find an efficient algorithm for synchronous agent-interactions in concurrent STM ABS
