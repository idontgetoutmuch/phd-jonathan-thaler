we now know how to engineer time- and event-driven ABS with complex state both in the agent and environment, main difficulty is direct agent-interaction (see macal classification into 4 types of ABS), compile-time guaranteed reproducibility, explicit handling of complex state (read only, read/write), concurrency explicit and limited to STM, very promising concurrency but direct agent-interactions main problem (erlang as a rescue?), main drawbacks: everything is explicit, performance

\section{Further Research}
generalise concepts explored into a pure functional ABS library in Haskell (called chimera)
dependent types and linear types are the next big step
