\chapter{Pure Functional Time-Driven ABS}
\label{ch:timedriven}

In the following, we derive a pure functional approach for an agent-based SIR model in which we pose solutions to the previously mentioned problems. We start out with a first approach in Yampa and show its limitations. Then we generalise it to a more powerful approach, which utilises Monadic Stream Functions, a generalisation of FRP. Finally we add a structured environment, making the example more interesting and showing the real strength of ABS over other simulation methodologies like System Dynamics and Discrete Event Simulation \footnote{The code of all steps can be accessed freely through the following URL: \url{https://github.com/thalerjonathan/phd/tree/master/public/purefunctionalepidemics/code}}.
