\chapter{Pure Functional Time-Driven ABS}
\label{ch:timedriven}

In this chapter, we pose solutions to the previously mentioned problems by derive a pure functional approach for time-driven ABS through the example of the agent-based SIR model. We start out with a first approach in Yampa and show its limitations. Then we generalise it to a more powerful approach, which utilises Monadic Stream Functions (MSF), a generalisation of FRP. Finally we add a structured environment, making the example more interesting and showing the real strength of ABS over other simulation methodologies like System Dynamics and Discrete Event Simulation \footnote{The code of all steps can be accessed freely through the following URL: \url{https://github.com/thalerjonathan/phd/tree/master/public/purefunctionalepidemics/code}}.
