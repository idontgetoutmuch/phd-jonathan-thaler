\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}
%TODO SCIENTIFIC WORK: WARNING: i must be careful not to show some evidence of benefits / drawbacks. otherwise its not scientific. so i need a very careful argument / narrative which avoids FP vs OOP but still allows some judgement over both in terms of Advantages and drawbacks

%TODO claim that oop does work for ABS but makes things difficult by shared mutae state which is combined with behaviour. we hypothesize that a separation of both  state/data which is also immutable and behaviour leads to substantial benefits which are explored throughout this thesis. obviously nothing comes without a cost and we also take care pointing them out. fp allows to separate both by Definition

% THE PROBLEM
The traditional approach to Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) has so far always been object-oriented techniques, due to the influence of the seminal work of Epstein et al \cite{epstein_growing_1996} in which the authors claim "[..] object-oriented programming to be a particularly natural development environment for Sugarscape specifically and artificial societies generally [..]" (p. 179). This work established the metaphor in the ABS community, that \textit{agents map naturally to objects} \cite{north_managing_2007}, which still holds up today. %TODO can we cite any statistics about number of developed ABS models?

% MOTIVATION and AIM
This thesis challenges the metaphor and explores ways of approaching ABS with the \textit{pure} functional programming paradigm using the language Haskell. To the best of the authors knowledge, it is the first one to do so on a \textit{systematical} level, developing a foundation by presenting fundamental concepts and advanced features to show how to leverage the paradigms benefits \cite{hudak_history_2007} to become available when implementing ABS functionally. By doing this, the thesis both shows \textit{how} to implement ABS purely functional and \textit{why} it is of benefit of doing so, what the drawbacks are and also when a pure functional approach should \textit{not} be used. 

\medskip

TODO: consider putting the description of the gintis case here as it puts everything into a more interesting perspective and gives further motivation.

% SCOPE
This thesis claims that the agent-based simulation community needs functional programming because of its \textit{scientific computing} nature, where results need to be reproducible and correct while simulations should be able to massively scale-up as well. Due to the primarily computational character of most ABS models, not requiring IO or direct user-interaction, a pure functional approach should be able to directly deliver these non-functional requirements. The established object-oriented approaches need considerably high effort and might even fail to deliver these objectives due to its conceptually different approach to computing as they lack strong static typing, use mutable shared state and have implicit side-effects. 

Further, we regard the functional approach as a way to think and explore ABS in a deeper way - especially to develop a deeper and more complete understanding on the computational structure underlying ABS. It is well known, that functional programming helps in structuring computation in a very clear and precise way, leading to a deeper understanding about problems. So we also see it as a tool for developing abstractions which give us a a deeper understanding of the computational structures involved in ABS. By implementing use-cases, reflecting on them and generalising we extract implicit knowledge and make it explicit. We hope that this undertaking is to the whole benefit of the ABS discipline and will also feed back into the traditional implementation techniques of OOP.

% RESEARCH QUESTION and HYPOTHESEIS
Thus this thesis' general research question is \textit{how to implement ABS purely functional and what the benefits and drawbacks are of doing so.} Further, it hypothesises that by using pure functional programming for implementing ABS makes it is easy to add parallelism and concurrency, the resulting simulations are easy to test and verify, applicable to property-based testing, guaranteed to be reproducible already at compile-time, have fewer potential sources of bugs and thus can raise the level of confidence in the correctness of an implementation to a new level.

\medskip

Note that this thesis is \textit{not} about comparing the object-oriented and pure programming paradigm in the context of implementing ABS. Such an approach would not be fruitful, as too much ink has been spilt already over which paradigm is better / worse. There seems to be no scientific evidence supporting that either one is truly superior over the other; each has its benefits and weaknesses and this thesis is primarily interested in establishing them for the pure functional programming paradigm.

\section{Contributions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item This thesis is the first to \textit{systematically} investigate the use of the functional programming paradigm, as in Haskell, to ABS, laying out in-depth technical foundations and identifying its benefits and drawbacks. Due to the increased interested in functional concepts which were added to object-oriented languages in recent years, because of its established benefits in concurrent programming, testing and software-development in general, presenting such foundational research gives this thesis significant impact. Also it opens the way for the benefits of FP to incorporate into scientific computing, which are explored in the contributions below.
	
	\item This thesis is the first to show the use of Software Transactional Memory (STM) to implement concurrent ABS and its potential benefit over lock-based approaches. STM is particularly strong in pure FP because of retry-semantics can be guaranteed to exclude non-repeatable persistent side-effects already at compile time. By showing how to employ STM it is possible to implement a simulation which allows massively large-scale ABS but without the low level difficulties of concurrent programming, making it easier and quicker to develop working and correct concurrent ABS models. Due to the increasing need for massively large-scale ABS in recent years \cite{lysenko_framework_2008}, making this possible within a purely functional approach as well, gives this thesis substantial impact.
	
	\item This thesis is the first to present the use of property-based testing in ABS which allows a declarative specification- testing of the implemented ABS directly in code with \textit{automated} test-case generation. This is an addition to the established Test Driven Development process and a complementary approach to unit testing, ultimately giving the developers an additional, powerful tool to test the implementation on a more conceptual level. This should lead to simulation software which is more likely to be correct, thus making this a significant contribution with valuable impact.

	\item This thesis is the first to outline the potential use of \textit{dependent types} to Agent-Based Simulation on a \textit{conceptual level} to investigate its usefulness for increasing the correctness of a simulation. Dependent types can help to narrow the gap between the model specification and its implementation, reducing the potential for conceptual errors in model-to-code translation. This immediately leads to fewer number of tests required due to guarantees being expressed already at compile time. Ultimately dependent types lead to higher confidence in correctness due to formal guarantees in code, making this a unique contribution with high impact.

\section{Thesis structure}
%This thesis focuses on a strong narrative which tells the story of \textit{how} to do ABS with pure functional programming, \textit{why} one would do so and when one should \textit{avoid} this paradigm in ABS.

The thesis is divided into 5 parts which act as the thematic narrative throughout the text followed by an Appendix . 

\paragraph{Part I} opens the thesis by laying out the necessary prerequisites necessary to understand the ideas and motivation in the rest of the thesis.
\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:intro} introduces the problem and presents the motivation, aim and hypotheses.

\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:literature} presents related research. This chapter is rather short as remarkably there exists very little research in this field.

\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:methodology} discusses the background necessary to understand the rest of the thesis. It presents a definition of ABS and gives a short introduction to functional programming with advanced topics necessary to understand the concepts of this thesis. Further it briefly summarises the established approach to implement ABS.

\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:impl_abs} discusses an architectural categorisation on how to implement ABS from a language-agnostic point of view. 

\medskip

\paragraph{Part II} presents \textit{how} to do ABS in pure functional programming. 
\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:timedriven} derives a time-driven ABS implementation for an agent-based SIR model. Because it is the starting chapter it goes quite into detail to lay out the basic concepts.

\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:eventdriven} presents an event-driven approach to ABS using the highly complex Sugarscape model. It takes up the concepts derive in the previous Chapter \ref{ch:timedriven}, generalises them and pushes them forward to a more generic solution. Further it also gives a brief outline how to transform the time-driven SIR implementation into an event-driven one.

\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:structure_abs_computation} takes a highly abstract look at the computational approach and structures, derived in quite an ad-hoc fashion in the previous two Chapters \ref{ch:timedriven}, ref{ch:eventdriven}. It distils the essence of the SF and MSF constructs and shows that by looking at their building blocks \textit{closures} and \textit{continuations} SF and MSF can be regarded as very simple, immutable, pure functional objects. Further it looks at how they relate to existing computational structures like Monads, Comonads and Arrows.

\medskip

\paragraph{Part III} presents parallel computation in ABS as the first of two parts of \textit{why} pure functional ABS is of benefit.
\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:parallelism_ABS} shows rather briefly how to achieve deterministic and pure parallelism in pure functional ABS. 

\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:concurrent_abs} presents an in-depth discussion on how to implement concurrent ABS using Software Transactional Memory.

\medskip

\paragraph{Part IV} presents property-based testing in ABS as the second of two parts of \textit{why} pure functional ABS is of benefit.
\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:agentspec} shows how to use property-based testing to implement a full agent-specification of the SIR model in code and run it as property-tests.

\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:sir_invariants} shows how to derive and encode invariants the dynamics of the simulation must uphold in property-tests. Further it shows how to compare two implementations of the same underlying model: the time- and event-driven SIR implementations.

\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:prop_sirspec} discusses how to put model specifications into code and check them with property-tests: it shows how to compare the SD simulation to the agent-based one.

\medskip

\paragraph{Part V} is the closing part which looks at the thesis as a whole, discusses and concludes.
\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:gintis_case} presents the case of an agent-based model which results lead to high hopes in the field of computational economics, only to be found out that it had several bugs, weakening the results. In this chapter we ask whether a pure functional approach would have been of benefit in this case; more specifically, could those bugs have been prevented with a pure functional approach?

\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:discussion} puts all parts in perspective to each other and the initial motivation and hypothesis and discusses them under these viewpoints.

\medskip

Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes the thesis.

\paragraph{Appendices} contains additional material which relates to the overall research of this thesis but would be out of context in the respective chapters which refer to it.
\medskip

Appendix \ref{app:sd_simulation} shows a pure functional implementation of the SIR SD simulation using functional reactive programming (FRP). Its show that we can directly encode SD specification in pure functional FRP code with extremely high guarantees in correctness. We use this implementation in Chapter \ref{ch:prop_sirspec} where we test the agent-based SIR dynamics against the SD ones.

\medskip

Appendix \ref{app:equilibrium_totality} discusses the deep question of whether it is possible to test or guarantee that a correct implementation of the SIR model does terminate or not. This question arises in the context of Chapter \ref{ch:sir_invariants} and \ref{ch:agentspec}.

\medskip

Appendix \ref{app:validating_sugarscape} contains a brief overview over the validation process we went through when trying to get our Sugarscape implementation from Chapter \ref{ch:eventdriven} in line with the results from the original specification \cite{epstein_growing_1996}. Further we show how we can use propery-based testing in this exploratory model to formulate and test hypotheses.

\section{Publications}
Throughout the course of the Ph.D. five (5) papers were attempted to publish and four (4) were accepted:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Art Of Iterating - Update Strategies in Agent-Based Simulation \cite{thaler_art_2017} - This paper derives the 4 different update-strategies and their properties possible in time-driven ABS and discusses them from a programming-paradigm agnostic point of view. It is the first paper which makes the very basics of update-semantics clear on a conceptual level and is necessary to understand the options one has when implementing time-driven ABS purely functional.
	
	\item Pure Functional Epidemics \cite{thaler_pure_2019} - Using an agent-based SIR model, this paper establishes in technical detail \textit{how} to implement time-driven ABS in Haskell using non-monadic FRP with Yampa and monadic FRP with Dunai. It outlines benefits and drawbacks and also touches on important points which were out of scope and lack of space in this paper but which will be addressed in the Methodology chapter of this thesis.
	
	\item A Tale Of Lock-Free Agents (TODO cite) - This paper is the first to discuss the use of Software Transactional Memory (STM) for implementing concurrent ABS both on a conceptual and on a technical level. It presents two case-studies, with the agent-based SIR model as the first and the famous SugarScape being the second one. In both case-studies it compares performance of STM and lock-based implementations in Haskell and object-oriented implementations of established languages. Although STM is now not unique to Haskell any more, this paper shows why Haskell is particularly well suited for the use of STM and is the only language which can overcome the central problem of how to prevent persistent side-effects in retry-semantics. It does not go into technical details of functional programming as it is written for a simulation Journal.

	\item The Agents' New Cloths? Towards Pure Functional Agent-Based Simulation (TODO cite) - This paper summarizes the main benefits of using pure functional programming as in Haskell to implement ABS and discusses on a conceptual level how to implement it and also what potential drawbacks are and where the use of a functional approach is not encouraged. It is written as a conceptual / review paper, which tries to "sell" pure functional programming to the agent-based community without too much technical detail and parlance where it refers to the important technical literature from where an interested reader can start.
	
	\item Show Me Your Properties! The Potential Of Property-Based Testing In Agent-Based Simulation - This paper introduces property-based testing on a conceptual level to agent-based simulation using the agent-based SIR model and the Sugarscape model as two case-studies. 
\end{enumerate}
