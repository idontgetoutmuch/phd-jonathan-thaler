\chapter{Methodology}
This chapter introduces the background and methodology used in the following chapters. Roughly 50\% exists already.

\section{Agent-Based Simulation}
History, methodology (what is the purpose of ABS: 3rd way of doing science: exploratory, helps understand real-world phenomena), classification according to \cite{macal_everything_2016}, ABS vs. MAS, event- vs. time-driven \cite{meyer_event-driven_2014}, examples: agent-based SIR, SugarScape, Gintis Bartering

\subsection{Traditional approaches}
Introduce established implementation approaches to ABS. Frameworks: NetLogo, Anylogic, Libraries: RePast, DesmoJ. Programming: Java, Python, C++. Correctness: ad-hoc, manual testing, test-driven development.

\subsection{Verification \& Validation}
Introduction Verification \& Validation (V \& V in the context of ABS).
