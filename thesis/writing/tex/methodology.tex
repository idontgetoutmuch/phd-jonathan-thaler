\chapter{Methodology}
This chapter introduces the methodology, used in the following chapters:

Various types of ABs
1. time-driven vs. event-driven ABS, 2. time-driven: start with update-strategies, 3. present pure functional approach, 4. how can we implement the 4 update-strategies of the art-iterating paper in our pure functional approach, 5. interaction between agents, 6. event-driven ABS

\begin{itemize}
	\item Defining and introducing Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) (History, ABS vs. MAS, examples, event- vs. time-driven).
	\item Introduce established implementation approaches to ABS (Frameworks: NetLogo, Anylogic, Libraries: RePast, DesmoJ, Programming: Java, Python, Correctness: ad-hoc, manual testing, test-driven development)
	\item Introduction Verification \& Validation (V \& V in the context of ABS).
	\item Introduction to functional Programming in Haskell (functions, types, recursion, algebraic data-types, higher-order functions, continuations, Define and explain side-effects and purity: monads, different types of effects, explain IO and that it is of fundamental importance to avoid it in our research).
	\item Introduction to dependent types (Example, Equality as Type, Philosophical Foundations: Constructive mathematics)
\end{itemize}
