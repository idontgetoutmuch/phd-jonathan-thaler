\section{Discussion}
There is a strong relation between property-based tests and dependent types: in property-based testing we express specifications / properties / laws in code and test their invariance at run-time by random sampling the space. In dependent-types it is possible to express such properties already statically in types. This is the subject of the next part of the thesis which tries to move towards dependent types in ABS.
