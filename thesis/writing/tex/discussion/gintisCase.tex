\chapter{The Gintis Case}
\label{sec:gintis_case}
Discuss my developed techniques to the Gintis paper (and its follow ups: the Ionescu paper \cite{botta_functional_2011} and a Masterthesis \cite{evensen_extensible_2010} on it). Answer the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Do the techniques transfer to this problem and model? 
	
	\item Could pure functional programming have prevented the bugs which Gintis made? 
	
	\item Would property-based tests have been of any help to preven the bugs?
	
	\item Could dependent and / or types have prevented the bugs which Gintis made? 
	
	\item How close is our (dependently typed) implementation to Ionescus functional specification? 
	
	\item When having Cezar Ionescu as external examiner, this chapter will be of great influence as it deals heavily with his work.

\end{enumerate}

TODO: my hypothesis is that with a clean and rigorous pure functional implementation it would have been more likely to spot the bug as it would have been stated more explicitly but it would not be guaranteed to be avoided - the same is true for dependent types unless one focuses on getting this bit explicitly right but that would be unfair comparison. however, i hypothesize that with an in-depth property-based testing he could have avoided / found that mistake - and he should have done in-depth property-based testing (verification and validation) due to the fundamental importance of his undertaking and the implications of a positive outcome

Not yet started, need to implement it but there exists code for it already (gintis and java implementations)

%
%after re-reading ionescu paper: too complex and out of scope, but ionescu work more directly applicable in a pure functional implementation than in e.g. c++ (that was what they used).
%
%we base our implementation on the existing gintis code from https://people.umass.edu/gintis/ 
%also we make use of the \cite{evensen_extensible_2010} on gintis work which revealed a few bugs
%
%NOTE: my hypothesis is that just by having used our pure functional approach would NOT have prevented gintis to have made the bugs as reported in the masterthesis \cite{evensen_extensible_2010} because they seemed to be like copy-paste bugs. Only rigorous code-testing (unit- / property-based) would have probably revealed these problems.
