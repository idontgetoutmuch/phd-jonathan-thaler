\section{Towards Pure Functional ABS}
% the problem
It was unclear how to represent agents: how can we express agent identity, local agents state, changing behaviour and interactions amongst agents and the environment? After all this is straightforward in OO due to mutable shared state encapsulated in objects.

% the answer
The solution was to use arrowized FRP both in the pure implementation of Yampa and the monadic version as in the library Dunai. Building on top of them allowed us to implement pro-activity of agents, encapsulation of local agent state, an environment as shared mutable state and synchronous agent-interactions based on an event-driven approach. The central concept behind these approaches are Signal Functions (SFs) (generalised in Dunai to Monadic Stream Functions MSF) which are implemented using closures and continuations, fundamental building blocks and concepts of pure functional programming. SFs/MSFs can be seen as very simple \textit{immutable} objects with a single method following a \textit{shared nothing} semantics as mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:structure_abs_computation} already. This interpretation of SFs and MSFs and the fact that we seem to achieve encapsulation of local agent state and interactions obviously raises the question if agents actually \textit{do} map naturally to objects - after all, despite being in a pure functional setting, we are talking about objects again!

%Then on the other hand... my education and thinking was influenced for 15+ years by object oriented thinking, so this could be also the case that i intuitionally arrive at such a solution again.
