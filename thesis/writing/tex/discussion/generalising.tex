\section{Generalising Research}
We hypothesize that our research can be transferred to other related fields as well, which puts our contributions into a much broader perspective, giving it more impact than restricting it just to the very narrow field of ABS. Although the subsequent sections are just conjectures, we argue that our findings might be applicable to the following fields at least on a conceptual level.

\subsection{Simulation in general}
We showed at length in this thesis that purity in a simulation leads to repeatability which is of utmost importance in scientific computation. These insights are easily transferable to simulation software in general and might be of huge benefit there. Also my approach to dependent types in ABS might be applicable to simulations in general due to the correspondence between equilibrium \& totality, in use for hypotheses formulation and specifications formulation as pointed out in Appendix \ref{app:equilibrium_totality}. 

\subsection{System Dynamics}
We have implemented a System Dynamics (SD) simulation in Appendix \ref{app:sd_simulation}. Although it is only an implementation of the SIR model, it shows clearly how an SD \textit{specification} can directly be encoded in pure functional programming using arrowised FRP. The approach is simple enough to be generated automatically, is highly performant and could serve as language of choice for an SD simulation engine backend. We leave a deeper exploration of this topic for further research.

\subsection{Discrete Event Simulation}
We have already implemented basic mechanics of a Discrete Event Simulation in the case of the event-driven SIR. Still our approach is quite ABS-centric and it would be very interesting to see whether we can express the DES model network directly in code, guaranteeing compatibility of elements statically at compile time. This should be possible due to the declarative nature of pure functional programming and the process-oriented nature of arrowized Functional Reactive Programming - in the end both DES and FRP model data-flow networks which are fixed at compile time, so it should be a natural fit.

There exists also Parallel DES (PDES) \cite{fujimoto_parallel_2017}, which is concerned about the problems of running a DES in parallel, where the challenge is how to deal with sequential dependencies. Optimistic approaches run them in parallel, just like STM does, and rolls back actions in case sequential orderings are violated. We hypothesize that in a pure functional language with or without STM it should be conceptually easier to implement such rollback semantics due to immutable persistent data-structures and controlled side-effects.
 
\subsection{Recursive Simulation}
Due to the recursive nature of functional programming we believe that it is also a natural fit to implement recursive simulations as the one discussed in \cite{gilmer_recursive_2000}. In recursive ABS agents are able to halt time and anticipate an arbitrary number of actions, compare their outcome to resume time and continue with a specifically chosen action e.g. the best performing or the one in which they haven't died. More precisely, an agent has the ability to run the simulation recursively a number of times where the number is not determined initially but can depend on the outcome of the recursive simulation. So recursive ABS gives each Agent the ability to run the simulation locally from its point of view to project its actions into the future and change them in the present. Due to controlled side-effects and referential transparency, combined with the recursive nature of pure functional programming, we think that implementing a recursive simulation in such a setting should be straight-forward. We leave this for further research.

\subsection{Multi Agent Systems}
The fields of Multi Agent Systems (MAS) and ABS are closely related where ABS has drawn much inspiration from MAS \cite{wooldridge_introduction_2009}, \cite{weiss_multiagent_2013}. It is important to understand that MAS and ABS are two different fields where in MAS the focus is more on technical details, implementing a system of interacting intelligent agents within a highly complex environment with the focus on solving AI problems.

Because in both fields, the concept of interacting agents is of fundamental importance, we expect our research also to be applicable in parts to the field of MAS. Especially the work on static guarantees and dependent types should be very useful there because MAS is very interested in correctness, verification and formally reasoning about a system and their agents, to show that a system follows a formal specifications.
