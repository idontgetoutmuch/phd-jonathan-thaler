\chapter{Applicability of Object-Oriented modelling Frameworks}
TODO: this does not really belong here

TODO: discusses if and how peers object-oriented agent-based modelling framework can be applied to our pure functional approach. TODO: i need to re-read peers framework specifications / paper from the simulation bible book.
Although peers framework uses UML and OO techniques to create an agent-based model, we realised from a short case-study with him that most of the framework can be directly applied to our pure functional approach as well, which is not a huge surprise, after all the framework is more a modelling guide than an implementation one. E.g. a class diagram identifies the main datastructures, their operations and relations, which can be expressed equally in our approach - though not that directly as in an oo language but at least the class diagram gives already a good outline and understanding of the required datafields and operations of the respective entities (e.g. agents, environment, actors,...). A state diagram expresses internal states of e.g. an agent, which we discussed how to do in both our time- and even-driven approach. A sequence diagram e.g. expresses the (synchronous) interactions between agents or with their environment, something for which we developed techniques in our event-driven approach and we discuss in depth there.
