\chapter{The Equilibrium - Totality Correspondence}
\label{ch:equilibrium_totality}

TODO: this is still research to be done but a full treatment of them in context of ABS is beyond the scope of this phd (and also don't have enough knowledge and time), and would be enough for a new phd / habilitation. Can we outline basics and ideas without going too much into depth or is this not possible in a phd?
