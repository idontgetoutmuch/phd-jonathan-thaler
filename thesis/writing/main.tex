\section*{Abstract}
This thesis systematically investigates the use of the \textit{pure} functional programming paradigm for implementing Agent-Based Simulations (ABS) and provides in-depth discussions on the benefits and drawbacks when doing so. As language of choice, Haskell is used due to its modern, \textit{pure} nature and increasing use in real-world applications.

First, the thesis explore \textit{how} to implement ABS pure functionally, discussing both a time- and event-driven approach. In each case arrowized Functional Reactive Programming plays a fundamental role to derive fundamental abstractions and concepts. As use cases the well known explanatory agent-based SIR and the exploratory Sugarscape model are used. Then the thesis explores \textit{why} it is of benefit to implement ABS pure functionally, where it focuses on parallelism and concurrency and property-based testing.

TODO first version for others to read: until 18th July (before going to SummerSim conference)
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Refine Discussion part, structure is average: Agent-interactions in discussion chapter is not coherent and comes across as strange, refine it; Actor based ABS in conclusion chapter is not coherent and comes across as strange, refine it

	\item write abstract

	\item PRINT OUT full proof reading by me but this time back-to-front, focus on:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item when citing multiple references, make sure they are in ascending order of their reference number	
		\item the usage of we if it indicates scientific nature, using we for personal matters if its only me, this is not ok	
		\item types / function names / monad names ITALIC!?	
		\item be consistent about italics: use it for types, functions and emphasising certain word
		\item move links from footnote into references and put full implementations of existing models from phd repo in separate gitrepso. e.g. sugarscape, SIR event and time as and reconcile all code into thesis code folder?
		\item check for each reference if it makes sense and hand-tweak them if not ok	, DOI?	
		\item for references add hyperlinks using howpublished in case it is a blog or website (e.g. stephen diel what i wish...)	
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

TODO "cleaning up / polishing" milestone until end of August 2019
\begin{enumerate}
	\item reading by my supervisors

	\item reading by james hey
	
	\item reading by thomas schwarz for content
		
	\item proof-reading by professional lector (Karly), focus on 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item s vs 's vs. s' e.g. Agents vs. Agents's vs. Agents'
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

%TODO: from the 2nd annual review i got the feedback that i need to come up with a more coherent thesis structure which tells a story: i need to make myself clear what story i want to tell with my phd and what research and publications i still need to do for that (identify chapters and to which extent they are already finished). Also I need to come up with a precise publication plan, focusing on writing papers early than doing research for a too long time and starting an early thesis writing. This is because any unpublished research is lost and every published research is a contribution to knowledge. "A good PhD is asking more questions than it answers."
