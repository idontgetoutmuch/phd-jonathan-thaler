\section*{Abstract}
This thesis systematically investigates the use of the \textit{pure} functional programming paradigm for implementing Agent-Based Simulations (ABS) and provides in-depth discussions on the benefits and drawbacks when doing so. As language of choice, Haskell is used due to its modern, \textit{pure} nature and increasing use in real-world applications. 

%The thesis presents various implementation techniques to ABS and then discusses concurrency and parallelism and verification and validation in ABS in a pure functional setting. Additionally the thesis briefly discusses the use of dependent types in ABS, to close the gap between specification and implementation - something the presented implementation techniques don't focus on.
%Finally a case-study is presented which tries to bring together the insights of the previous chapters by replicating an agent-based model both in pure and dependently typed functional programming. The agent-based model which was selected was much discussed in ABS communities as it claimed to have solved a fundamental problem of economics but it was then found that the implementation had a number of bugs which shed doubt on the validity and correctness of the results. The thesis' case study investigates whether this failure could have happened in pure and dependent functional programming and is a further test to see of how much value functional programming is to ABS.

TODO first version for others to read: until 18th July (before going to SummerSim conference)
\begin{enumerate}
	\item consistency of words / expressions
		\begin{itemize}
			\item the usage of we if it indicates scientific nature, using we for personal matters if its only me, this is not ok			
			\item upper/lower case in chapters, sections and subsections inconsistent: start with capital letter and then continue with lower case unless it is a name or abbreviation
			\item s vs 's vs. s' e.g. Agents vs. Agents's vs. Agents'
			\item case study vs. case-study (no -)
			\item Monad vs monad - write them UPPER case
			\item speedup vs speed up vs speed-up
			\item types / function names / monad names ITALIC!?
			\item main-thread vs main thread
			\item update-strategy or update strategy?
			\item typeclass instead of type class
			\item avoid FP, replace by functional programming and OO, replace by object-oriented
			\item avoid don't, won't, haven't, e.g.,... and write them all out
			\item avoid most hyphens: compile time, signal function, type system, type parameter, main thread, case study, software engineering, time step, straightforward (no hyphen!)...
			\item be consistent about italics: use it for types, functions and emphasising certain word
		\end{itemize}

	\item go through all references and extract them in separate file into the thesis folder. add hyperlinks using howpublished in case it is a blog or website (e.g. stephen diel what i wish...)
	
	\item when citing multiple references, make sure they are in ascending order of their reference number
	
	\item Refine Discussion part, structure is average: Agent-interactions in discussion chapter is not coherent and comes across as strange, refine it; Actor based ABS in conclusion chapter is not coherent and comes across as strange, refine it

	\item full proof reading by me but this time back-to-front
\end{enumerate}

TODO "cleaning up / polishing" milestone until end of August 2019
\begin{enumerate}
	\item reading by my supervisors

	\item reading by james hey
	
	\item reading by thomas schwarz for content
		
	\item proof-reading by professional lector (Karly)
	
	\item extract all references of the thesis in separate file and manually fine-tune them so that they are perfect: including DOI, include link to webpage in case of a blog,...
	
	\item put full implementations of existing models from phd repo in separate gitrepso. e.g. sugarscape, SIR event and time as and reconcile all code into thesis code folder?
\end{enumerate}

%TODO: from the 2nd annual review i got the feedback that i need to come up with a more coherent thesis structure which tells a story: i need to make myself clear what story i want to tell with my phd and what research and publications i still need to do for that (identify chapters and to which extent they are already finished). Also I need to come up with a precise publication plan, focusing on writing papers early than doing research for a too long time and starting an early thesis writing. This is because any unpublished research is lost and every published research is a contribution to knowledge. "A good PhD is asking more questions than it answers."
