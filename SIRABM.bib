abstract = {Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is a methodology in which a system is simulated in a bottom-up approach by modelling the micro interactions of its constituting parts, called agents, out of which the global system behaviour emerges.So far mainly object-oriented techniques and languages have been used in ABS. Using the SIR model of epidemiology, which simulates the spreading of an infectious disease through a population, we demonstrate how to use pure Functional Reactive Programming to implement ABS. With our approach we can guarantee the reproducibility of the simulation at compile time and rule out specific classes of run-time bugs, something that is not possible with traditional object-oriented languages. Also, we found that the representation in a purely functional format is conceptually quite elegant and opens the way to formally reason about ABS.},

abstract = {Monads are by now well-established as programming construct in functional languages. Recently, the notion of "Arrow" was introduced by Hughes as an extension, not with one, but with two type parameters. At first, these Arrows may look somewhat arbitrary. Here we show that they are categorically fairly civilised, by showing that they correspond to monoids in suitable subcategories of bifunctors $C^{op}\times C \rightarrow C$. This shows that, at a suitable level of abstraction, arrows are like monads --- which are monoids in categories of functors $C \rightarrow C$. Freyd categories have been introduced by Power and Robinson to model computational effects, well before Hughes' Arrows appeared. It is often claimed (informally) that Arrows are simply Freyd categories. We shall make this claim precise by showing how monoids in categories of bifunctors exactly correspond to Freyd categories.}
