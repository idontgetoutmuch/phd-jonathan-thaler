# Code 

Steps 4 - 6 need the BearRiver library from https://github.com/thalerjonathan/dunai in which I have added primitives which are there in Yampa but were still missing in BearRiver on hackage. When building and running with stack, this is already configured, when building and running with cabal, clone the repo and install it into a sandbox.
