\section{TODO-List as of \today}

\begin{enumerate}
  
\item Refine Research-Context A: ACE
	\begin{itemize}
    \item look into ACE in general
    \item look into agent-based market models
	\item READ NASDAQ MARKET SIMULATION: seems extremely interesting as it builds an ABM for simulating the stock market.
	\item look into ACE and formulate research questions. look for the killerfeature for ACE which is possible only in haskell and is not just a technical detail. EDSL for qualitative modelling? EDSL where model = runnable code?
	\item  NOT in economics but a METHOD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
	\item THUS: no research in combining complicated models (e.g. applying budish paper of batch-auctions to ABS model of markets): my direction agent-based market models IN GENERAL and what we can earn from doing that in FP
	\item look for the killerfeature for ACE which is possible only in haskell and is not just a technical detail. EDSL for qualitative modelling? EDSL where model = runnable code?
	\end{itemize}
	 
\item Refine Research-Context B: Free Will in ABS
	\begin{itemize}
	\item MetaABS: continue reading and thinking about Mind, Free Will and Conciousness for inspiration
	\item Find a model to apply to: SugarScape?
	\end{itemize}

\item Define 5 general research questions for each Research-Context
	\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 related to FP
    \item 1 related to integration of FP to ABM/S
    \item 2 related to ABM/S
    \end{itemize}

\item 2nd Paper: functional reactive ABS
	\begin{itemize}
		\item define formal agent definition
		\item implement in yampa / dunai: sugarscape
		\item define a minimal functional specification-language for ABM which is equals / very close to Haskell code 
		\item look into QuickCheck
		\item problem: so far only agents with same static messagetypes, environment and states, can communicate: the agents are homogenous. how can we implement hetereogenous agents in this library?
		\item implement wait blocking for a message so far. utilize yampas event mechanism?
	\end{itemize}

\item Phd Thesis Title: Foundations of functional ABS
	\begin{itemize}
		\item functional specification language
		\item theory of computation in ABS: type theoretic and category theoretic foundations of ABS
		\item implementing pure functional ABS/M: fusion with FRP
		\item reasoning in functional ABS
		\item a case study: pure functional ABS in ACE / Social Sciences / Artificial Life / Philosophy
	\end{itemize}

\item got hint for publishing paper in: ppsm parallel problem solving in nature OR natural computation
