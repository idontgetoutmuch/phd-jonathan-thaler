\subsection{2nd Year: Main Work}
Applying 1st year results, methods and experiences to develop and write main paper to be published in a journal in 3rd year thus in 2nd year the main  work and implementation will be done. The idea is to start from Ionescus Framework \cite{Botta20114025} and build on his paper.

\begin{itemize}
\item Implement Ionescous framework using the methodology developed in 1st year
\item Generalize implementation to market models
\item Learn Agda and dependent types
\item Dig deeper into equilibrium theory 
\item Get into market-microstructure: \cite{LehalleLaruelle2013}, \cite{baker_market_2013}
\item Dig into \textit{emergent properties} of systems. Can they be formalized?
\item Get into basics of Category-Theory \cite{Pierce1991} \cite{spivak_category_2014}
\item Get into basics of Type-Theory (found good lectures on Youtube)

\end{itemize}
