\subsection{1st Year: Groundwork}
In this year I will learn basics and develop and research the methodology I will use for the main work in the 2nd year. Also I want to write a paper about this work and try to publish it on a Conference or Journal. The time-frame will be set by the date of the 1st year annual oral report which will happen beginning of July thus there are about 6 Months time (counting including January '17 and leaving out July '17). These are the things I want / need to achieve this year:

\begin{itemize}
\item Prototyping in Haskell, Scala and Java
\item Study Actor-Model theory: Hewitt, Greif, Clinger, Agha
\item Get into reasoning about programs
\item Basics of Economics \cite{bowles_understanding_2005}, \cite{kirman_complex_2010}
\item Basics of ACE: Tesfatsion
\item Implement PureAgents Library
\item Write \& publish paper
\item Write 1st year report
\item Prototype ACE using Akka and Haskell
\end{itemize}

Important and mile-stones:
