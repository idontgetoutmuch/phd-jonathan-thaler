\section{Prisoners Dilemma Specification}

1. calculate local payoff for all. INCLUDE ITSELF!!! otherwise it would not work. this is not 100\% clear in both papers as it is quite not logical: why play the prisoner-dilemma with one self? if one does not include itself, the patterns don't emerge.
2. calculate local best for all based upon local payoff
