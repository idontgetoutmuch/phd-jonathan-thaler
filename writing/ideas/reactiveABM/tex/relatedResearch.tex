\cite{schneider_towards_2012} and \cite{vendrov_frabjous:_2014} present a domain-specific language for developing functional reactive agent-based simulations. This language called FRABJOUS is very human readable and easily understandable by domain-experts. It is not directly implemented in FRP/Haskell/Yampa but is compiled to Haskell/Yampa code which they claim is also readable. This is the direction we want to head but we don't want this intermediate step but look for how a most simple domain-specific language embedded in Haskell would look like. In this paper we explicitly dive deep into FRP And Yampa and see how we can combine the best of both.
