\section{Introduction}
Because the selection of an update-strategy has profound implications for the implementation of an ABS we investigate the three different programming-paradigms of \textit{object-orientation} (OO), \textit{pure functional} and \textit{multi-paradigm} in the form of the programming languages Java, Haskell and Scala in their suitability of implementing each update-strategy. As it turns out the paradigms can't capture all the update-strategies equally well thus one should be careful when selecting the implementation language for the ABS, reflecting its suitability for implementing the selected updates-strategy.
