\begin{abstract}
Meta Agent-Based Simulation (MetaABS) is an attempt of modelling free will on a computational basis. We focus on free will which we define as having the ability to anticipate results from one actions thus creating a feedback on the actions. Here we follow the interpretation that anticipation means 'to simulate' in the context of ABS. We follow the concept of irreducibility of computation which, due to undecidability - requires to run (=simulate) a program to actually know its output. The idea is in each step of the simulation let agents simulate the same simulation they are situated in from their point of view for a given number of steps before they take their next step. Thus the simulation is defined in terms of recursion, a novelty and something we will describe in depth in this paper. We claim that functional programming is especially well suited to implement MetaABS due to its lack of implicit side-effects, natural parallelism and declarative way of describing WHAT systems are instead of HOW they compute. Obviously this new approach has a problem: an agent would need to have complete information about the whole simulation, an assumption which is completely unrealistic. We introduce the term of 'reduced-recursive' which assumes that the next recursive level is a reduced version of the original, very local to the agent, thus solving the problem of complete information.
We don't know yet in which field to apply this research, but we could follow economics, social sciences and artificial life.
