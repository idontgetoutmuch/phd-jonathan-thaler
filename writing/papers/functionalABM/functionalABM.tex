\begin{abstract}
In this paper we look at the very simple social-simulation of \textit{Heroes \& Cowards} invented by \cite{wilensky_introduction_2015} to study new methods in Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABM/S) and to highlight their potentials and limitations as opposed to object-oriented (OO) ones which are dominant in this field. We go into the opposite direction and ask how ABM/S can be done using the Actor-Model as defined by \cite{agha_actors:_1986} and pure functional programming in Haskell. Both are methods which have unfortunately not been considered very deeply in this field and requires to look at ABM/S from a different perspective which this paper tries to provide. The Actor-Model was a major influence in the development of Agents and has proven its use in Erlang for building industry-strength applications but the question whether it is well suited for ABM/S is still open to question. A functional direction offers a wealth of new powerful tools and methods where the most obvious benefits of using a pure functional approach is that it allows to reason about various properties of the program and implementation of an embedded domain-specific language (EDSL), where ideally the distinction between specification and implementation disappears. \\
Thus we implemented a new library in Haskell for ABM/S called \textit{PureAgents}, available on Hackage, making maximum use of the functional paradigm and utilizing the Actor-Model as the underlying paradigm for thinking, representing, modelling and implementing Agents. We compare the implementation of \textit{Heroes \& Cowards} in \textit{PureAgents} with a variety of implementations in other existing methods. For comparison with state-of-the-art methods we look at the classic implementation in NetLogo, implement the model in AnyLogic and ReLogo and also look into an object-oriented implementation in Java without using any ABM/S framework. To have a comparison with a method which is close to our new developed library we look into Scala which is a multi-paradigm approach to functional programming and allows to incorporate objects and side-effects and comes already with an Actor-Library. \\
The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we describe how to approach and implement ABM/S in the pure functional language Haskell resulting in a library for ABM/S called \textit{PureAgents} available on Hackage. Second, the library is based on the Actor-Model defined by  which so far hasn't got much attention for systematic research in the field of ABM/S and functional programming - a drawback we want to repair.
