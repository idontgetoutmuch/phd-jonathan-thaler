\begin{abstract}
This paper explores how to use random property-based testing on a technical level to encode and test specifications of agent-based simulations (ABS). The claim is that opposed to unit testing, random property-based testing is a much more natural fit to test ABS due to both stochastic nature. The paper shows how to test full agent- and model-specifications, in the case of an agents behaviour, its transition probabilities and model invariants. The outcome are specifications expressed directly in code, which relate whole classes of random input to expected classes of output. During test execution, random test data is generated automatically, potentially covering the equivalent of thousands of unit tests, run within seconds. The expressiveness and power of property-based testing is not only limited to be part of a test-driven development process where it acts as specification, verification and regression test but can be integrated as a fundamental part of the model development process, supporting the hypothesis and discovery making process. By incorporating this powerful technique into the simulation development process the confidence in the correctness of an implementation increases dramatically, something of fundamental importance for ABS in general and for ABS supporting far-reaching policy decisions in particular.
