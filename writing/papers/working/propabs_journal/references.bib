	abstract = {Agent-based simulation (ABS) is a recent modeling technique that is being widely used in modeling complex social systems. Forrester's System Dynamics (SD) is another longstanding technique for modeling social systems. Several classical models of systems, such as the Kermack-McKendrick model of epidemiology, the Lotka-Volterra equations for modeling predator-prey relationships, and the Bass model for innovation diffusion are formulated as systems of differential equations and have corresponding System Dynamics representations as difference equations. The ABS and SD modeling approaches take fundamentally different perspectives when modeling a system, which can be characterized as bottom-up (ABS) versus top-down (SD). Yet many systems can be equivalently modeled by either approach. In this paper, we present a formal specification for SD and ABS models, use the specification to derive equivalent ABS representations, and present an example of an SIR epidemic model having SD and ABS counterparts.},

Recently, Agile Software Development (ASD) methods enjoy an increasing popularity. eXtreme Programming (XP) techniques, one of the techniques which belong to the ASD group of methods is a software development method which improves software quality and responsiveness of software projects through introducing short development cycles and a Test Driven Development (TDD) philosophy throughout the development. In this paper, we particularly pay attention to the application of the TDD by approaching simulation development from a test-first perspective. This study consists of a feasibility study of applying the TDD technique in simulation development in its various levels, say, acceptance and unit testing. Moreover, a simulation case study of a surgical ward has been considered, designed and implemented using the AnyLogic simulation toolkit. Our study differs from the mainstream in many ways. It addresses the feasibility of Test-Driven Simulation Development in Visual Interactive Modelling and Simulation (VIMS) environments as well as providing an insight into how the test-first concept can further help with the choice of components and acceptance testing.},

When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and are better equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them. TDD eliminates tentative traits, it teaches programmers to communicate, and it encourages team members to seek out criticism However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out individually! In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be continually tested and refactored.

Techniques that can help to improve V\&V in simulation modelling are needed. This paper proposes a V\&V technique called TestDriven Simulation Modelling (TDSM) which applies techniques from Test-Driven Development in software engineering to simulation modelling. The main principle in TDSM is that a unit test for a simulation model has to be specified before the simulation model is implemented. Hence, TDSM explicitly embeds V\&V in simulation modelling. We use a case study in maritime search operations to demonstrate how TDSM can be used in practice. Maritime search operations (and search operations in general) are one of the classic applications of Operational Research (OR). Hence, we can use analytical models from the vast search theory literature for unit tests in TDSM. The results show that TDSM is a useful technique in the verification and validation of simulation models, especially ABS models. This paper also shows that ABS can offer an alternative modelling approach in the analysis of maritime search operations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This process can be complex and is an iterative one where changes in domain knowledge and model requirements or specifications can cause changes in the software that in turn may require additional modeling and domain knowledge. Test-driven development is a software development technique that can help ameliorate this complexity by evolving a loosely coupled flexible design, driven by the creation of many small, automated unit tests. When the focus shifts to writing small tests that exercise the simulations behavior, the larger problem of translating a conceptual model into working code is decomposed into a series of much smaller, more manageable and highly focused translations.

The first example demonstrates how branching statements with floating point operands of comparison operators create a high degree of nonlinearity, leading in this case to the creation of 'ghost' agents – visible to some parts of the program but not to others. A potential solution to this problem is proposed. The second example shows how mathematical descriptions of models in the literature are insufficient to enable exact replication of work since mathematically equivalent implementations in terms of real number arithmetic are not equivalent in terms of floating point arithmetic.},

We suggest that a clear description of the phenomena to be explained by the model and testing for the simplest possible realistic agent rules of behaviour are key to the successful validation of ABMs and will provide the strongest base for enabling model comparison and acceptance. In particular, the empirical evidence that in general agents act intuitively rather than rationally is now strong. This implies that models which assign high levels of cognition to their agents require particularly strong justification if they are to be considered valid.},

With our approach we can guarantee the reproducibility of the simulation at compile time and rule out specific classes of run-time bugs, something that is not possible with traditional object-oriented languages. Also, we found that the representation in a purely functional format is conceptually quite elegant and opens the way to formally reason about ABS.},
