% aim of the paper is to build on the rather conceptual paper by me at summersim19 and show property-based testing in ABS on a much more technical level by the case studies of:
%	- encoding agent-specifications of time- and event-driven ABS SIR into property-based tests
%	- random event sampling
%	- compare two different implementations
% 	- and encode model invariants
