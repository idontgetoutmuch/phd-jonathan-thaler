Reviewer 2:
-- SIR model —> don't use acronyms in the abstract. I don't think this sentence is needed, though.

— "is likely to increase dramatically," —> too weak of a sentence. If there any experiments to back this claim up.

— Abstract also refers to SIR without explaining what it is.

— After reading the introduction, I was left wondering about two things:
        — Is this incremental work? How much more is done wrt. to the previous paper?
        — What are the main contributions?

— given rate of β other people —> is β a percentage or a number?

— "In the following we follow [7] for translating —> don't use citations as part of sentences. This is bad style.

— doesn't —> does not (do no use contractors)

— There is no need to have one section with just one subsection, like section 6. Future work can be one paragraph.

— Is there a replication package available?

The authors support their claims using an agent-based SIR model as use case and demonstrate how property-based testing. This is just an
example and either the authors discuss potential threats to generalisation or they discuss how to apply this to any agent-based system.

There are several sentences that are weak, with words such as "we are convinced", "we think", "believe". All these sentences need to be
backed up.

I've liked the paper, but I think that it would be much more believable if the authors would conduct a user study with a couple of users (like 5),
showing that it indeed brings great benefits (e.g., injecting faults, ...)
