(1) there are claims that need to be better justified and make sure they are supported (R1; R2); 

R1 "There are still some claims that could be better justified." Unfortunately R1 did not tell which claims need to better justified, so we could not improve on it.

(2) the related work section should include a brief comparison between the proposed approach and the related works as well as some related work on V&V of agent-based simulation (R1; R2);

R1 "The related work section should include a brief comparison between the proposed approach and the related works"

TODO i clearly need to improve on that

(3) and given the work presented previously by the authors [34], clarify the main contributions of this paper warranting a journal publication (R1; R2).

R1 "The work presented is significant and important yet it is build on a previous, recent paper by the same authors. The added value of the article is still not so clear."

TODO I clearly need to improve on that, explaining it better in the introduction and mention it more often in the text by referring to my original work [34]

R2:
- Abstract is extremely long and lacks focus
TODO

- This was a question I had before, and it remais: given the work presented previously by the authors [34], I wonder whether the contributions of this paper warrants a journal publication.
- It is not clear what are the advances of this paper when compared to the previous paper by the same authors. After a quick scan, that conceptual paper seems pretty solid already
TODO make it more clear

-  I commend the authors for including a related work section, but it seems to be missing several works on V&V of agent-based simulation. 
TODO https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1363686.1363696?casa_token=wLqIFCFkIFEAAAAA:gSFqeN-SyPQBQCl_jI5Mljj2mEeFOTX3ZVhzTTD_L5Kr2XyevQmUxaNxBhEpIbTECdz_NJZSjUw.

- I would suggest to make it clear that [13] is a paper published by the authors. 
[13] is clearly a mistake by the reviewer as it refers to "Colell, A.M.: Microeconomic Theory". We published [34], which is the paper this journal submission builds on. However, we clearly stated this in the introduction.
Additionally we refer to another paper published by us: [33], however this has a very different focus than this journal submission.
TODO We made now clear that we published [33].

- Section 5 without a user study is a bit problematic. At least the authors need to discuss a bit more the potential issues when asking someone to encode a specification (learning curve, etc).
TODO again we do not have the means to conduct a user study as carefully explained in the resubmission. Therefore a user study is simply not possible. If this is not accepted by the reviewer, then we will agree to the consequences and retract the paper.
TODO add further research section, where we put user study

-- More importantly, I think the authors missed my point about generalisation. Showing that it works on a concrete example does not give the reader
concrete evidence that it will work for any ABS system. This needs to be clearly discussed. Otherwise the contributions of the paper are rather limited.
- The authors support their claims using an agent-based SIR model as use case and demonstrate how property-based testing. This is just an
example and either the authors discuss potential threats to generalisation or they discuss how to apply this to any agent-based system.
TODO



R3 
- "However, the authors refer to the source code of their software in the following reference:" 32. Thaler, J.: Repository of Agent-Based SIR implementation in Haskell (2019). URL https://github.com/thalerjonathan/haskell-sir. A Github repository should not be the only source of the source code, as it is unlikely to be available in the long term (>5 years). The authors should archive their code somewhere else as well, preferably an institutional repository with a DOI.
TODO: i have published also in other journals and conferences which have accepted github. Also i argue that a github repo is much more likely to be available than an institutional repo. besides, the gitrepo comes with a number of benefits: checkout, cloning, forking, history of changes,... Therefore we have to turn down this request.
