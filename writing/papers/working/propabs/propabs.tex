\usepackage[pdftex,colorlinks=true,urlcolor=blue,citecolor=black,anchorcolor=black,linkcolor=black]{hyperref}

%% The next versions of the hyperref command are used if you adopt the
%% outdated latex-dvips-ps2pdf route in generating your pdf file. In
%% this case you can use ps or eps files for graphics, but not pdf, jpeg, png etc.
%% However, the final pdf file should embed all fonts required which means that you have to use file
%% formats which can embed fonts. Please note that the final PDF file will not be generated on your computer!
%% If you are using WinEdt or PCTeX, then use the following. If you are using
%% Y&Y TeX then replace "dvips" with "dvipsone"

%% \usepackage[dvips,colorlinks=true,urlcolor=blue,citecolor=black,%
%% anchorcolor=black,linkcolor=black]{hyperref}

%% The use of the long citation format (e.g. "Brown and Edwards (1993)" rather than "[5]") and at the same
%% time using the hyperref package can lead to hard to trace bugs in case the citation is broken accross the
%% line (usually this will mark the entire paragraph as a hyperlink (clickable) which is easily noticeable and fixed
%% if using colorlinks, but not if the color is black -- as it is now). Worse yet, if a citation spans page boundary,
%% LaTeX compilation can fail, with an obscure error message. Since this depends a lot on the flow of the text
%% and wording, these bugs come and go and can be extremely hard for a beginner to trace. The error
%% message can look like this:
%%
%%    ! pdfTeX error (ext4): \pdfendlink ended up in different nesting level than \pdfstartlink.
%%    \AtBegShi@Output ...ipout \box \AtBeginShipoutBox 
%%    \fi \fi 
%%    l.174 
%%    ! ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
%%
%% and can be universally fixed by putting an \mbox{} around the citation in question (in this case, at line 174)
%% and maybe adapting the wording a little bit to improve the paragraph typesetting, which is perhaps not
%% immediately obvious.

\section*{Abstract}
%TODO: target Summer Simulation Conference: http://scs.org/summersim/
%- there are two possible sub-tracks for it: Agent-based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) or Verification and Validation of Computer Simulation Models (V&V).

This paper presents property-based testing, a novel approach of testing implementations of agent-based simulations (ABS). It is a complementary technique to unit-testing and allows to test specifications and laws of an implementation directly in code which is then checked using \textit{automated} test-data generation. As case-studies, we present two different models, an agent-based SIR model and the SugarScape model, in which we will show how to apply property-based testing to explanatory and exploratory agent-based models and what its limits are.
%We conducted our research in the pure functional programming language Haskell, which is the origin of property-based testing. Besides being especially suited for property-based testing, it supports strong isolation in unit-tests and controlled side-effects which further increases isolation of tests and allows extremely convenient checking of invariants.

\textbf{Keywords:} Agent-Based Simulation, Validation \& Verification, Property-Based Testing, Haskell.
