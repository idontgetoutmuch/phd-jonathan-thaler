\section{Case-Study: Pure Functional SugarScape}
TODO

why sugarscape
- original sugarscape sparked ABS and use of OOP, therefore 
- quite complex model, will challenge implementation techniques

\section{Chapter II}
Straight-forward because agents interact with each other indirectly through the environment. In each step the agents are shuffled and updated one after another, where agents can see actions of agents updated before. This is implemented by sharing the environment as a shared data-structure amongst all agents which can read/write it - this is possible in functional programming using Monadic Programming which can simulate a global state, accessible from within a function which can then read/write this state. 

\section{Chapter III}
The main challenge begins here because in this chapter the agents first
