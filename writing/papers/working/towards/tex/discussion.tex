Benefits:
- reproducibility guaranteed at compile time: same initial conditions guaranteed to lead to same outputs
- parallelism and concurrency
- refactoring very convenient and quickly becomes the norm: guided by types (change / refine them) and relying on compiler to point out problems, results in very effective and quick changes without danger of bugs showing up at run-time. This is not possible in Python because of its lack of compiler and types, and much less effective in Java due to its dynamic type-system although through IDE support one arrives also at a highly strong refactoring performance there.

Drawbacks:
- performance
- heavier in engineering
- agent-agent interaction is more complex
