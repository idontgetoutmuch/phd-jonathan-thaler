\section{Introduction}
The traditional approach to Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) has so far always been object-oriented techniques, due to the influence of the seminal work of Epstein et al \cite{epstein_growing_1996} in which the authors claim \textit{"[..] object-oriented programming (OOP) to be a particularly natural development environment for Sugarscape specifically and artificial societies generally [..]"} (p. 179). This work established the metaphor in the ABS community, that \textit{agents map naturally to objects} \cite{north_managing_2007} which still holds up today. 

Although we agree that OOP is a good fit for ABS, in this paper we present ways of implementing ABS in the functional programming  paradigm using the language Haskell \cite{hudak_history_2007}. We believe that functional programming (FP) has its place in ABS as well because of ABS' \textit{scientific computing} nature where results need to be reproducible and correct while simulations should be able to be exploit parallelism and concurrency as well. 
We claim that by using FP for implementing ABS it is less difficult to add parallelism and correct concurrency, the resulting simulations are easier to test and verify, guaranteed to be reproducible already at compile-time, have fewer potential sources of bugs and are ultimately more likely to be correct. 

To substantiate our claims, we first present fundamental concepts and advanced features of functional programming and then show how they can be used to engineer clean, maintainable and reusable ABS implementations. Further we discuss how the well known benefits of functional programming in general are applicable in ABS. We discuss this in the context of a practical case-study we conducted, in which we implemented the a \textit{full} and \textit{validated} SugarScape model \cite{epstein_growing_1996} in Haskell. 

The aim and contribution of this paper is to introduce the functional programming paradigm using Haskell to ABS on a \textit{conceptual} level, identifying benefits, difficulties and drawbacks. This is done through the above mentioned case-study which introduces general implementation techniques applicable to ABS and investigates benefits and drawbacks leveraged from functional programming. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do so within the ABS community.

The structure of the paper is as follows. 
In Section \ref{sec:related_work} we present related work on functional programming in ABS. 
In Section \ref{sec:fp} we introduce the functional programming paradigm, establish key features, motivate why we chose Haskell, discuss its type system and side-effects. 
In Section \ref{sec:case_study} we present our approach in the context of our Sugarscape case-study together with the challenges encountered and its benefits and drawbacks.
In Section \ref{sec:discussion} we discuss our initial claims in the light of the case-study.
In Section \ref{sec:conclusions} we conclude and point out further research.
In Appendix \ref{app:validation} we give a deeper insight into our process of validating our Sugarscape model against the book and \cite{epstein_growing_1996} and an already existing NetLogo replication \cite{weaver_replicating_nodate}.
