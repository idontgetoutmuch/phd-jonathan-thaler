1. thanks
2. we re-ran all experiments because new hardware AND using criterion which ensured much more precise timings and most important statistically highly robust results.
3. we added ReadWrite lock in SIR
4. we added Hybrid (atomic) implementation in SIR
5. we addressed the 'unfairness' of TArray vs IO in Sugarscape: it sounds nice but is actually simply impossible. might be possible with a highly involved locking algorithm but we didn't go into this
6. we addressed all other minor problems and added a bit more detail to the STM background section (one additional example)
