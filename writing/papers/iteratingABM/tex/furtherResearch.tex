\section{Further Research}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Yampa
	\item Reasoning in Haskell about the Model \& Simulation
	\item Develop a small modelling-language which is close to the Haskell-Version of modelling agents therefore specification and implementation match
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Functional Reactive Programming}
The implemented framework in Haskell is lacking features like TODO and is basically an attempt of reinventing Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). We were aware of the existence of this paradigm, especially the library Yampa, but decided to leave that one to a side and really keep our implementation clear and very basic. The next step would be to fusion our implementations with Yampa thus leveraging both approaches from which we hypothesize to gain the ability to develop much more complex models with heterogeneous agents.
