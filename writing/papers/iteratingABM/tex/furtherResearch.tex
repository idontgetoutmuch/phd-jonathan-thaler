\section{Further Research}

\subsection{Functional Reactive Programming}
The implemented framework in Haskell is lacking features like TODO and is basically an attempt of reinventing Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). We were aware of the existence of this paradigm, especially the library Yampa, but decided to leave that one to a side and really keep our implementation clear and very basic. The next step would be to fusion our implementations with Yampa thus leveraging both approaches from which we hypothesize to gain the ability to develop much more complex models with heterogeneous agents.

\subsection{Functional Model-Specification Language}
After showing that Haskell is a very attractive alternative to existing OO approaches in implementing ABS we are interested whether the declarative power of the pure functional language can be utilized to write specifications for simple ABS models. Such a language would be equals or very close to the program-code thus eliminate the gap between specification and programming.

\subsection{Actor Model in ABS}
We find that the Actor Model should get more attention in ABS and although we showed that the Act-Strategy implemented in Scala with Actors can implement very different kind of Models we barely scratched the surface. We hope that more research is going into this topic as we feel that the Actor-Model has a bright future ahead due to the ever increasing availability of massively parallel computing machinery. TODO: mention the work on Erlang in ABS
