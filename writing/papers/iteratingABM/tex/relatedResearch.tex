\cite{botta_time_2010} sketch an agent-framework in Haskell which is very similar also utilizing an agent-transforming function which consumes incoming messages and produces outgoing ones. Thus this approach, very well developed in ABM/S, seems to be a very natural one also to apply to Haskell. Instead of iterating a simulation with a global time, their focus is on how to synchronize agents which have internal, local transition times. They introduce a time-keeper agent which synchronizes the actions of all of the agents thus we argue that our framework is able to capture it faithfully using the \textit{Actor-Strategy}.
