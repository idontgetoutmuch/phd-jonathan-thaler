\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Selecting the correct Iteration-Strategy is of most importance and must match the model semantics
	\item Java: best for non-parallel, non-concurrent strategy
	\item Scala with Actors: best for concurrency
	\item Surprise: Haskell can faithfully implement all strategies equally well, something not anticipated in the beginning
\end{itemize}
