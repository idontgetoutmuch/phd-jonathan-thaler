\section{Results}
In this section we report and discuss the results of our experiments with Meta-ABS. In Table \ref{tab:model_configuration} we give the configuration of the model which is the same for all experiments. For the future move-optimization additional parameters are set, which are mentioned in the respective section.

\begin{table*}[t]

	\caption{Model Configuration}
	\label{tab:model_configuration}
		\begin{tabular}{ l | l }
			\hline \hline
			\textbf{Dimensions}					& 50 x 50 \\  
			\textbf{World-type}					& Torus	\\ 
			\textbf{Density}					& 0.75	\\ 
			\textbf{Similarity required}		& 0.8	\\ 
			\textbf{Agent-distribution}			& 50\% Red, 50\% Green	\\ 
			\textbf{Local-movement distance}	& 5	\\ 
			\textbf{Find-free-place retries}	& 4	\\

\end{table*}


What we are interested in are the following dynamics
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Global happiness (Yes / No) over time
	\item Global similarity over time
	\item Global change of similarity between steps
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-optimizing}
Agents move to the nearest free spot. This is included because it is needed for the hypothesis for anticipating in non-deterministic future
Hypothesis: very slow convergence, can't solve high density with high similarity requirements.

\subsection{Optimizing}
Agents move to the nearest free spot which satisfies their requirements

Hypothesis: should have much faster convergence than non-optimizing, areas act as attractors

\subsection{Anticipating}
TODO: how many agents are predicting? fraction between 0.0 and 1.0
TODO: compare the performance of the predicting-agents to the non-predicting ones

Prediction-Ratio hypothesis: increasing the ratio of predicting agents will decrease the effectiveness of the predictions because the future becomes then in effect non-deterministic

Deterministic future Hypothesis: 				faster convergence than optimizing

Non-Deterministic future Hypothesis:			complete breakdown, falling back to dynamics of Non-optimizing
