\section{Introduction}
main message: optimistic PDES needs rollback of events which is particularly easily achieved in Haskell because: 1. it has persistent immutable data-structure resulting in a new version after an update where one still can hold the old version, 2. one can restrict side-effects to one which are guaranteed to be able to rollback and not having an effect on the real-world e.g. IO. Also using Haskell has the potential to come up with a DSL to declaratively implement DES models e.g. express a DES model in terms of sinks, sources, delays,... on a declarative level.

because DES can be the foundation for an event-driven ABS we benefit from looking at PDES as well to get inspiration for parallelisation of ABS

rollback should be easy with SFs as well. with MSFs more delicate because of side-effects

Contribution: first ones to describe haskells immutable data properties and STM to implement PDES
