\section{Introduction}
main message: PDES needs rollback of events which is particularly easily achieved in Haskell because: 1. it has persistent immutable data-structure resulting in a new version after an update where one still can hold the old version, 2. one can restrict side-effects to one which are guaranteed to be able to rollback and not having an effect on the real-world e.g. IO

Contribution: first ones to describe haskells immutable data properties and STM to implement PDES
