\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
The authors of \cite{botta_functional_2011} are using functional programming as a specification for an agent-based model of exchange markets but leave the implementation for further research where they claim that it requires dependent types. This paper is the closest usage of dependent types in agent-based simulation we could find in the existing literature and to our best knowledge there exists no work on general concepts of implementing pure functional agent-based simulations with dependent types. As a remedy to having no related work to build on, we looked into works which apply dependent types to solve real world problems from which we then can draw inspiration from. 

The authors of \cite{brady_correct-by-construction_2010} use depend types to implement correct-by-construction concurrency in the Idris language \cite{brady_idris_2013}. They introduce the concept of a Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL) for concurrently locking/unlocking and reading/writing of resources and show that an implementation and formalisation are the same thing when using dependent types. We can draw inspiration from it by taking into consideration that we might develop a EDSL in a similar fashion for specifying general commands which agents can execute. The interpreter of such a DSEL can be pure itself and doesn't have to run in the IO Monad as our previous research (TODO: cite my PFE paper) has shown that ABS can be implemented pure.

In \cite{brady_idris_2011} the authors discuss systems programming with focus on network packet parsing with full dependent types in the Idris language \cite{brady_idris_2013}. Although they use an older version of it where a few features are now deprecated, they follow the same approach as in the previous paper of constructing an EDSL and and writing an interpreter for the EDSL. In a longer introduction of Idris the authors discus its ability for termination checking in case that recursive calls have an argument which is structurally smaller than the input argument in the same position and that these arguments belong to a strictly positive data type. We are particularly interested in whether we can implement an agent-based simulation which termination can be checked at compile time - it is total.

TODO \cite{fowler_dependent_2014} dependent types for safe and secure web programming
TODO \cite{brady_state_2016} state machines all the way down
TODO \cite{brady_type-driven_2017} dependent state machine, dependently typed concurrent communication

The fundamental difference to all these real-world examples is that in our approach, the system evolves over time and agents act over time. A fundamental question will be how we encode the monotonous increasing flow of time in types and how we can reflect in the types that agents act over time.


%The authors of \cite{ionescu_dependently-typed_2012} discuss how to use dependent types to specify fundamental theorems of economics, unfortunately they are not computable and thus not constructive, thus leaving it more to a theoretical, specification side.
