\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
To our best knowledge there exists no work on concepts of implementing pure functional agent-based simulations with dependent types. The authors \cite{botta_functional_2011} are using functional programming as a specification for an agent-based model of bilateral trading but don't give a real implementation e.g. in Haskell but just propose dependent types as implementation in further research.
%The authors of \cite{ionescu_dependently-typed_2012} discuss how to use dependent types to specify fundamental theorems of economics, unfortunately they are not computable and thus not constructive, thus leaving it more to a theoretical, specification side.

As a remedy to having no related work to draw inspiration from, we looked into papers which apply dependent types to solve real world problems.
