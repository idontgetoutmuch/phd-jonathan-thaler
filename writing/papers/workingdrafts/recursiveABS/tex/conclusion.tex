\section{Conclusion and further research}

So far we only looked at recursive simulation in a simulation with a strictly sequential update-strategy where agents are updated in sequence after each other as defined in TODO: cite my Art-Of-Iteration Paper. We leave the question of how Meta-ABS would apply to the parallel update-strategy and whether it is reasonable to extend it to that strategy or not for further research.
