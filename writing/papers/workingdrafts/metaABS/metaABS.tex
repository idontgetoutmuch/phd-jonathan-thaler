\begin{abstract}
In this paper we ask what influence recursive Agent-Based Simulation has on the dynamics of a simulation. We investigate the famous Schelling Segregation and implement our agents with the ability to anticipate their actions by recursively running simulations. Based on the outcomes of the recursions they are then able to determine whether their move increases their utility in the future or not.
We investigate the dynamics of the MetaABS implementation and compare it to the movement-strategy of the original model. We hypothesize that in the case of a deterministic future this approach allows the agents to increase their utility as a group but we hypothesize that this is not the case when the future is non-deterministic as the power to predict is simply lost in this case.
Also we show that alone by looking at the implementation we can raise interesting philosophical questions about agents, anticipation, information, determinism.
The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of recursive agent-based simulation, a completely new method in ABS, which we termed MetaABS.
