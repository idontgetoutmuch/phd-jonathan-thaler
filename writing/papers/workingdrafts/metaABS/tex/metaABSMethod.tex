\section{Meta ABS}
Informally, Meta-ABS can be understood as giving the agents the ability to project the outcome of their actions in the future. They are able to halt time and 'play through' an arbitrary number of actions, compare their outcome and then to unhalt time and continue with a specifically chosen action e.g. the best performing or in which they haven't died. 

\subsection{Formal description}
explain the level two levels of recursion

\subsection{Interpretation}
TODO: how can be Meta ABS be interpreted?

how can we justify the ability of the agents to do that? real persons lack the information and the computational power to forecast such a complex problem.
