\section{Results}
In this section we report and discuss the results of our experiments with Meta-ABS. In Table \ref{tab:model_configuration} we give the configuration of the model which is the same for all experiments. For the future move-optimization additional parameters are set, which are mentioned in the respective section.

\begin{table*}[t]

	\caption{Model Configuration}
	\label{tab:model_configuration}
		\begin{tabular}{ l | l }
			\hline \hline
			\textbf{Dimensions}					& 50 x 50 \\  
			\textbf{World-type}					& Torus	\\ 
			\textbf{Density}					& 0.75	\\ 
			\textbf{Similarity required}		& 0.8	\\ 
			\textbf{Agent-distribution}			& 50\% Red, 50\% Green	\\ 
			\textbf{Local-movement distance}	& 5	\\ 
			\textbf{Find-free-place retries}	& 4	\\

\end{table*}


What we are interested in are the following dynamics
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Global happiness (Yes / No) over time
	\item Global similarity over time
	\item Global change of similarity between steps
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{No move-optimization}
Hypothesis: compared to others, slowest convergence/impossible to reach complete happiness
	
\subsection{Present move-optimization}
Hypothesis: should have much faster convergence than non-optimizing, areas act as attractors
	
\subsection{Future move-optimization}
TODO: how many agents are predicting? fraction between 0.0 and 1.0
TODO: compare the performance of the predicting-agents to the non-predicting ones

Prediction-Ratio
	hypothesis: increasing the ratio of predicting agents will decrease the effectiveness of the predictions because the future becomes then in effect non-deterministic

Deterministic future:
	Hypothesis without present:  	same as present-only
	Hypothesis with present: 		fastest convergence of all
		
Non-Deterministic future:
	Hypothesis without present: 	complete breakdown, falling back to dynamics of non-optimization
	Hypothesis with present: 		same as present-only optimization
