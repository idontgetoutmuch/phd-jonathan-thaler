\section{Results}

\subsection{Non-optimizing movement}
TODO: first show the dynamics of a difficult but solvable problem e.g. 51x51, 0.75 density, 0.5 similarity. 
TODO: cannot solve high density with high similarity: utility stays low

\subsection{Global optimizing movement}
TODO: show that global optimizing movement with can solve extremely difficult cases: 51x51, 0.9 density, 0.9 similarity. actually it doesnt mean it can really solve it but that it can increase the total utility dramatically compared to non-optimizing movement

\subsection{Future optimizing movement}
TODO: MetaABS
	- can it solve the difficult case which global optimizing can solve?
	- is it faster than global optimizing?
