What we are interested in are the following dynamics
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Global happiness (Yes / No) over time
	\item Global similarity over time
	\item Global change of similarity between steps
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{No move-optimization}
Hypotheses
	- local movement: compared to others, slowest convergence/impossible to reach complete happiness
	- global movement: should have faster convergence than local-movement, due to larger movement which results in faster escape of local minima, also global movement makes 
	
\subsection{Present move-optimization}
Hypotheses
	- local movement: should have much faster convergence than all non-optimizing, areas act as attractors
	- global movement: should have even faster convergence than local movement because moving globally and can find better globally 
	
\subsection{Future move-optimization}
TODO: how many agents are predicting?
TODO: compare the performance of the predicting-agents to the non-predicting ones

Deterministic future:
	Hypotheses
		- local / global movement without present:  
		- local / global movement with present: fastest convergence of all
		
Non-Deterministic future:
	Hypotheses
		- local / global movement without present: complete breakdown, falling back to dynamics of non-optimization
		- local / global movement with present: same as present only optimization
