\section{Results}

\subsection{Experiment Setup}

Setup: 
50x50, 0.8 density, 0.8 similarity, torus-world, 50/50 red/green distribution, local movement-radius 5

Dynamics:
- global happiness over time
- happiness-change between steps


\subsection{Future optimizing}
a fraction pf agents is predicting: see what influence it has

- deterministic future vs. non-deterministic future

questions:
	- can it solve the difficult case which global optimizing can solve?
	- is it faster than global optimizing?
