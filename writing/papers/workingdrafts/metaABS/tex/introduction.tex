\section{Introduction}
The 'meaning' of MetaABS is not really clear: how can it be interpreted?
It is not so much about the dynamics but more on the philosophical questions it raises.

But also we wanted to check if the same happens as in the recursive simulation paper \cite{gilmer_recursive_2000}: deterministic vs. non-deterministic AND one-agent recursion or all-agents recursion

We implemented our Meta-ABS in Haskell using the functional reactive programming paradigm following the Yampa library. We believe that pure functional programming is especially suited to implement Meta-ABS due to its lack of implicit side-effects and copying of data. The code is available freely under
TODO: until now the whole things is implemented in functionalReactiveABS,  when project and paper is finished, copy the code-base to metaABS and insert link
