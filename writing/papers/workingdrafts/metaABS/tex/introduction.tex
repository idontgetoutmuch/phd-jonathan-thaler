\section{Introduction}
The 'meaning' of MetaABS is not really clear: how can it be interpreted?
It is not so much about the dynamics but more on the philosophical questions it raises.
But also we wanted to check if the same happens as in the recursive simulation paper \cite{gilmer_recursive_2000} : deterministic vs. non-deterministic AND one-agent recursion or all-agents recursion

we are spanning up 3 dimensions: recursion-depth, replications, and time-steps

the agent who is initiating the recursion can be seen as 'knowing' that it is running inside a simulation, but the other agents are not able to distinguish between them running on the base level of the simulation or on a recursive level
