\section{Background}
\subsection{Schelling Segregation}

\subsubsection{Movement strategies}
We distinguish between two movement-strategies: local and global.

\subsubsection{Optimizing behaviour}
We distinguish between multiple optimization-strategies: 
	1. none at all: 				agent just move depending on their movement-strategy to another place if they are not happy on the current one - they don't care how the target place is in the present or in the future, they will decide again in the next time-step
	
	2. optimizing in the present: 				agent pick a free place depending on their movement-strategy and move to it if it satisfies the condition
	3. optimizing in the future: 				agent pick a free place depending on their movement-strategy and move to it if it satisfies the condition in the future
	4. optimizing in the present \& future: 	agent pick a free place depending on their movement-strategy and move to it if it satisfies the condition now and in the future - note that we can distinguish between conditions now and in the future: they may be the same or they may differ
	
	we introduce the condition: either it makes them happy or it just increases their utility but ultimately does not make them completely happy
