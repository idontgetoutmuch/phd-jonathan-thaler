\section{Background}

\subsection{Schelling Segregation}
We follow in our implementation the original paper of Schelling as in \cite{schelling_dynamic_1971} where we focus on the \textit{Area Distribution} section (Schelling starts with movement in a linear, 1-dimensional world where agents are able to move to the nearest point which meets the agents satisfaction but this is not what we follow here). One assumes a discrete 2-dimensional lattice-world with NxM fields. Each field is either occupied by an agent of a given color (e.g. Red or Green) or is free. Each field has 8 neighbours, which denotes a Moore-Neighbourhood. In Schellings original work the lattice-world is limited at its borders but we assume a torus world which is wrapped around in both the x- and y-dimensions resulting in 8 neighbours also for fields at the border. The occupation density was set by Schelling to be about 70\%-75\% which he identifies as being a setting which allows the agents to move around freely without making the lattice-world too sparse.
Now the agents make their move sequentially one after another. In each move an agent calculates the number of neighbours which are of equal color. If the number satisfies the agents needs about the neighbourhood then the agent is regarded as being 'happy' and will stay on this field. On the other hand the agent moves to the nearest unoccupied field which within its neighbourhood satisfies its needs.

NOTE: we stick with the deterministic movement of picking the \textit{nearest satisfying} field. This is also much more realistic when coming to predicting

\subsubsection{Anticipating behaviour}
Schelling explicitly mentions in \cite{schelling_dynamic_1971} that nobody anticipates moves of others. This is what we introduce using the recursive simulation. Agents select an unoccupied place as in the original model and move to it if it satisfies them in the future as well. The interpretation for that behaviour is: agents heard about an uprising place in town which they want to be part of, thus anticipating their moving there.

\subsubsection{Non-Deterministic Extensions}
TODO: for the non-deterministic future we need to extend this model with non-deterministic behaviour e.g. pick random position.
