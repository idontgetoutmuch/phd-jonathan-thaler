\section{Property-Based Testing}
Property-based testing allows to formulate \textit{functional specifications} in code which then a property-based testing library tries to falsify by \textit{automatically} generating test-data with some user-defined coverage. When a case is found for which the property fails, the library then reduces it to the most simple one. It is clear to see that this kind of testing is especially suited to ABS, because we can formulate specifications, meaning we describe \textit{what} to test instead of \textit{how} to test. Also the deductive nature of falsification in property-based testing suits very well the constructive and exploratory nature of ABS. Further, the automatic test-generation can make testing of large scenarios in ABS feasible as it does not require the programmer to specify all test-cases by hand, as is required in unit-tests.

Property-based testing was invented by the authors of \cite{claessen_quickcheck:_2000, claessen_testing_2002} in which they present the QuickCheck library, which tries to falsify the specifications by \textit{randomly} sampling the space. We argue, that the stochastic sampling nature of this approach is particularly well suited to ABS, because it is itself almost always driven by stochastic events and randomness in the agents behaviour, thus this correlation should make it straight-forward to map ABS to property-testing. The main challenge when using QuickCheck, as will be shown later, is to write \textit{custom} test-data generators for agents and the environment which cover the space sufficiently enough to not miss out on important test-cases. According to the authors of QuickCheck \textit{"The major limitation is that there is no measurement of test coverage."} \cite{claessen_quickcheck:_2000}. QuickCheck provides help to report the distribution of test-cases but still it could be the case that simple test-cases which would fail are never tested.

As a remedy for the potential sampling difficulties of QuickCheck, there exists also a deterministic property-testing library called SmallCheck \cite{runciman_smallcheck_2008} which instead of randomly sampling the test-space, enumerates test-cases exhaustively up to some depth. It is based on two observations, derived from model-checking, that (1) \textit{"If a program fails to meet its specification in some cases, it almost always fails in some simple case"} and (2) \textit{"If a program does not fail in any simple case, it hardly ever fails in any case} \cite{runciman_smallcheck_2008}. This non-stochastic approach to property-based testing might be a complementary addition in some cases where the tests are of non-stochastic nature with a search-space which is too large to implement manually by unit-tests but is relatively easy and small enough to enumerate exhaustively. The main difficulty and weakness of using SmallCheck is to reduce the dimensionality of the test-case depth search to prevent combinatorial explosion, which would lead to exponential number of cases. Thus one can see QuickCheck and SmallCheck as complementary instead of in opposition to each other.

Note that in this paper we primarily focus on the use of QuickCheck due to the match of ABS stochastic nature and the random test generation. We refer to SmallCheck in cases where appropriate. Also note that we regard property-based testing as \textit{complementary} to unit-tests and not in opposition - we see it as an addition in the TDD process of developing an ABS.
