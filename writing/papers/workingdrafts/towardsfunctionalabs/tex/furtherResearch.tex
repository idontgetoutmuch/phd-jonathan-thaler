\section{Further Research}
- STM
- multi-method simulation
	- can we do DES? e.g. single queue with multiple servers? also specialist vs. generalist use MSFs and event-queue
	- can we do SD? towards paper: sd is nearly correct by construction
	- emphasis that aivika is multi-method, gis, distributed. 
- idris with dependent type system arrive at potentially correct-by-construction
- other languages: Scala seems to be very promising and also supports very lightweight message-passing concurrency but has side-effects, erlang has no side-effects and is more centered around lightweight message-passing concurrency with distribution support, clojure / scheme are LISP dialects (lisp the first functional programming language) but also are implicitly effectful but support homoiconicity, F\# ?, ...
