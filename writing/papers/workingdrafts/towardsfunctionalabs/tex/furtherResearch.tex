\section{Further Research}
- STM
- multi-method simulation
	- can we do DES? e.g. single queue with multiple servers? also specialist vs. generalist use MSFs and event-queue
	- can we do SD? towards paper: sd is nearly correct by construction
	- emphasis that aivika is multi-method, gis, distributed. 
- idris with dependent type system arrive at potentially correct-by-construction
