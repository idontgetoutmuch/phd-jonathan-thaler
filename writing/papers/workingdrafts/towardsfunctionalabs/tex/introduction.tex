\section{Introduction}
TODO: main message is that FP is needed for abs to prevent different types of bugs which can be overcome by FP and dependent types. Still we would need testing e.g. property-based testing for run-time behaviour. Cite Gintis and Sweeney, find evidence for bugs in ABS, find classes of bugs in oop / imperative.

The traditional approach to Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) has so far always been object-oriented techniques, due to the influence of the seminal work of Epstein et al \cite{epstein_growing_1996} in which the authors claim "[..] object-oriented programming to be a particularly natural development environment for Sugarscape specifically and artificial societies generally [..]" (p. 179). This work established the metaphor in the ABS community, that \textit{agents map naturally to objects} \citep{north_managing_2007} which still holds up today.

In this paper we challenge this metaphor and explore ways of approaching ABS using the functional programming paradigm with the language Haskell. We present fundamental concepts and advanced features of functional programming and we show how to leverage the benefits of it \citep{hudak_history_2007} to become available when implementing ABS functionally.

We claim that by using functional programming, it is harder to make mistakes, the resulting simulations are easier to test and verify, guaranteed to be reproducible, have less potential sources of bugs as in \citep{vipindeep_list_2005} and are ultimately more likely to be correct. Still we need solid testing of our software and we explore this by employing property-based testing . All of this is of paramount importance in scientific computing, in which results need to be reproducible and correct while simulations should be able to scale up to massive numbers of agents as well. 

The aim of this paper is to conceptually show \textit{how} to implement ABS in functional programming using Haskell and \textit{why} it is of benefit of doing so. Further, we give the reader a good understanding of what functional programming is, what the challenges are in applying it to ABS and how we solve these in our approach. Although functional programming is a highly technical subject, we avoid technical discussions and follow a very high-level approach, focusing on the concepts instead of their implementation. For readers which are interested in technical details we refer to relevant literature in the respective parts of the paper.

The paper makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize*}
	\item To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the functional programming paradigm using Haskell to ABS on a \textit{conceptual} level, identifying benefits, difficulties and drawbacks.
	\item We show that functional programming concepts can be used to create simulation software which has less sources of bugs, is more likely to be correct and guaranteed to be reproducible already at compile-time.
	%\item We show how functional programming concepts can be used to scale ABS up to massively large-scale without the problems of low level concurrent programming.
	\item We show that functional programming concepts can be used to test ABS implementations using property-based testing, which allows a very expressive way of testing, shifting from unit- towards specification-based testing.
\end{itemize*}
