\section{Conclusions}
- its very much about types which guide and restrict us

Our approach is radically different from traditional approaches in the ABS community. First it builds on the already quite powerful FRP paradigm. Second, due to our continuous time approach, it forces one to think properly of time-semantics of the model and how small $\Delta t$ should be. Third it requires one to think about agent interactions in a new way instead of being just method-calls.
