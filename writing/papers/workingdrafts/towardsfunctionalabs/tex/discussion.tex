\section{Why: Discussion}
After having presented \textit{how} to implement ABS in the functional programming, we now discuss \textit{why} it is of benefit of doing so. We re-visit the claims made in the introduction and discuss each of them and show why they hold.

\subsection{Easy to add parallelism and concurrency}

\subsection{Hard to make mistakes}

\subsection{Easy to test and verify}
\cite{perez_testing_2017, perez_back_2017}

\subsection{Guaranteed to be reproducible}

\subsection{Few potential sources of bugs}

\subsection{Very likely to be correct}

\subsection{Problems}
Reasoning about space-leaks due to lazyness, space leaks biggest issue in fp approach, but also big strength as it allows to separate consumption from production

Currently, the performance of the system is not comparable to imperative implementations but our research was not focusing on this aspect. We leave the investigation and optimization of the performance aspect of our approach for further research.

In our pure functional approach, agent identity is not as clear as in traditional object-oriented programming, where an agent can be hidden behind a polymorphic interface which is much more abstract than in our approach. Also the identity of an agent is much clearer in object-oriented programming due to the concept of object-identity and the encapsulation of data and methods.

We can conclude that the main difficulty of a pure functional approach evolves around the communication and interaction between agents, which is a direct consequence of the issue with agent identity. Agent interaction is straight-forward in object-oriented programming, where it is achieved using method-calls mutating the internal state of the agent, but that comes at the cost of a new class of bugs due to implicit data flow. In pure functional programming these data flows are explicit but our current approach of feeding back the states of all agents as inputs is not very general. We have added further mechanisms of agent interaction which we had to omit due to lack of space.
