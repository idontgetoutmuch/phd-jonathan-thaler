\section{Further Research}

We see this paper as an intermediary and necessary step towards dependent types for which we first needed to understand the potential and limitations of a non-dependently typed pure functional approach in Haskell. Dependent types are extremely promising in functional programming as they allow us to express stronger guarantees about the correctness of programs and go as far as allowing to formulate programs and types as constructive proofs which must be total by definition \cite{thompson_type_1991}, \cite{altenkirch_why_2005}, \cite{altenkirch_pi_2010}.

So far no research using dependent types in agent-based simulation exists at all and it is not clear whether dependent types make sense in this context. In our next paper we want to explore this for the first time and ask more specifically how we can add dependent types to our pure functional approach, which conceptual implications this has for ABS and what we gain from doing so. We plan on using Idris \cite{brady_idris_2013} as the language of choice as it is very close to Haskell with focus on real-world application and running programs as opposed to other languages with dependent types e.g. Agda and Coq which serve primarily as proof assistants.

It would be of immense interest whether we could apply dependent types to the model meta-level or not - this boils down to the question if we can encode our model specification in a dependently typed way. This would allow the ABS community for the first time to reason about a model directly in code.
