\section{The SIR Model}
\label{sec:sir_model}
To explain the concepts of ABS and of our pure functional approach to it, we introduce the SIR model as a motivating example and use-case for our implementation. It is a very well studied and understood compartment model from epidemiology \cite{kermack_contribution_1927} which allows to simulate the dynamics of an infectious disease like influenza, tuberculosis, chicken pox, rubella and measles spreading through a population \cite{enns_its_2010}.

In this model, people in a population of size $N$ can be in either one of three states \textit{Susceptible}, \textit{Infected} or \textit{Recovered} at a particular time, where it is assumed that initially there is at least one infected person in the population. People interact \textit{on average} with a given rate of $\beta$ other people per time-unit and become infected with a given probability $\gamma$ when interacting with an infected person. When infected, a person recovers \textit{on average} after $\delta$ time-units and is then immune to further infections. An interaction between infected persons does not lead to re-infection, thus these interactions are ignored in this model. This definition gives rise to three compartments with the transitions seen in Figure \ref{fig:sir_transitions}.

This model was also formalized using System Dynamics (SD) \cite{porter_industrial_1962}. In SD one models a system through differential equations, allowing to conveniently express continuous systems which change over time, solving them by numerically integrating over time which gives then rise to the dynamics. We won't go into details here and provide the dynamics of such a solution shown in Figure \ref{fig:sir_sd_dynamics} with the given variables.

\subsection*{An Agent-Based approach}
The approach of mapping the SIR model to an ABS is to discretize the population and model each person in the population as an individual agent. The transitions between the states are happening due to discrete events caused both by interactions amongst the agents and time-outs. The major advantage of ABS is that it allows to incorporate spatiality as shown in section \ref{sec:step5_environment} and simulate heterogenity of population e.g. different sex, age,... something not possible with other simulation methods e.g. SD or Discrete Event Simulation (DES).

According to the model, every agent makes \textit{on average} contact with $\beta$ random other agents per time unit. In ABS we can only contact discrete agents thus we model this by generating a random event on average every $\frac{1}{\beta}$ time units. We need to sample from an exponential distribution because the rate is proportional to the size of the population \cite{borshchev_system_2004}. Note that an agent does not know the other agents' state when making contact with it, thus we need a mechanism in which agents reveal their state in which they are in \textit{at the moment of making contact}. This mechanism is an implementation detail which we will derive in our implementation steps. For now we only assume that agents can make contact with each other somehow.

This results in the following agent behaviour:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Susceptible}: A susceptible agent makes contact \textit{on average} with $\beta$ other random agents. For every \textit{infected} agent it gets into contact with, it becomes infected with a probability of $\gamma$. If an infection happens, it makes the transition to the \textit{Infected} state.

	\item \textit{Infected}: An infected agent recovers \textit{on average} after $\delta$ time units. This is implemented by drawing the duration from an exponential distribution \cite{borshchev_system_2004} with $\lambda = \frac{1}{\delta}$ and making the transition to the \textit{Recovered} state after this duration.
%\footnote{Note that these agents do \textit{not} pro-actively contact other agents. The rationale behind it is, that according to the theory of epidemiology, $\beta$ is defined as \textit{a contact which would be sufficient to lead to infection, were it to occur between a susceptible and an infected individual} \cite{abbey_examination_1952}. In this theory it wouldn't make sense to work out the $\beta$ value for someone who is already infected - the contact structure of the infected agents is implicit. Would we add pro-active contact making to the infected agents as well we would get very different results, not matching the SD dynamics which were validated in the past against real world epidemics \cite{ahmed_variance_2013}.}

	\item \textit{Recovered}: These agents do nothing because this state is a terminating state from which there is no escape: recovered agents stay immune and can not get infected again in this model. 
\end{itemize}
