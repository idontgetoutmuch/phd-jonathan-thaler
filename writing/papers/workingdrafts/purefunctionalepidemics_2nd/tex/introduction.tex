\section{Introduction}
The traditional approach to Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) has so far always been object-oriented techniques, due to the influence of the seminal work of Epstein et al \cite{epstein_growing_1996} in which the authors claim "[..] object-oriented programming to be a particularly natural development environment for Sugarscape specifically and artificial societies generally [..]" (p. 179). This work established the metaphor in the ABS community, that \textit{agents map naturally to objects} \cite{north_managing_2007} which still holds up today.

In this paper we fundamentally challenge this metaphor and explore ways of approaching ABS in a pure functional way using Haskell. By doing this we expect to leverage the benefits of pure functional programming \cite{hudak_history_2007}: higher expressivity through declarative code, being polymorph and explicit about side-effects through monads, more robust and less susceptible for bugs due to explicit data flow and lack of implicit side-effects.

As use case we introduce the simple SIR model of epidemiology with which one can simulate epidemics, that is the spreading of an infectious disease through a population, in a realistic way.

Over the course of four steps, we derive all necessary concepts required for a full agent-based implementation. We start from a very simple solution running in the Random Monad which has all general concepts already there and then refine it in various ways, making the transition to Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) \cite{wan_functional_2000} and to Monadic Stream Functions (MSF) \cite{perez_functional_2016}.

The aim of this paper is to show how ABS can be done in \textit{pure} Haskell and what the benefits and drawbacks are. By doing this we give the reader a good understanding of what ABS is, what the challenges are when implementing it and how we solve these in our approach.

The contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item TODO: declarative = main contribution, instead of "first", we present a novel approach, declarative analysis of ABS using FRP. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to \textit{systematically} introduce the concepts of ABS to the \textit{pure} functional programming paradigm in a step-by-step approach. It is also the first paper to show how to apply Arrowized FRP to ABS on a technical level, presenting a new field of application to FRP.
	\item TOOD: cite myself because I showed how different iterations strategies have different results on emergent phenomena,  because we can control effects and we can rule out run-time classes of bugs e.g. run-time polymorphism and data-dependencies because we exploit the strong type system. Our approach shows how robustness can be achieved through purity which guarantees reproducibility at compile time, something not possible with traditional object-oriented approaches.
	TODO reproducibility: in purely FP we can control the side-effects, we are side-effect polymorph which becomes very clear in the last step, the use of the word pure was probably not completely clear: use 'pure (without side-effects)'
	\item The result of using Arrowized FRP is a conceptually much cleaner approach to ABS than traditional imperative object-oriented approaches. It allows expressing continuous time-semantics in a much clearer, compositional and declarative way, without having to deal with low-level details related to the progress of time.
\end{itemize}

Section \ref{sec:related_work} discusses related work. In section \ref{sec:background} we define agent-based simulation, introduce functional reactive programming, arrowized programming and monadic stream functions, because our approach builds heavily on these concepts. In section \ref{sec:sir_model} we introduce the SIR model of epidemiology as an example model to explain the concepts of ABS. The heart of the paper is section \ref{sec:functional_approach} in which we derive the concepts of a pure functional approach to ABS in four steps, using the SIR model. Finally, we draw conclusions and discuss issues in section \ref{sec:conclusions} and point to further research in section \ref{sec:further_research}.
