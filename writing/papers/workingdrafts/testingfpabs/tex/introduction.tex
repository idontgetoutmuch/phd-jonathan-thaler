\section{Introduction}
We feel that code testing is still lacking in ABS and that there does not exist much research and work on it. We propose a new method, called property-based testing, from which we hypothesise that it is more expressive and allows testing ABS models more umfassend.

We use two models as case-studies :
- SIR, explanatory model: formulate formal model-specifications in property-tests
- Sugarscape, exploratory model: formulate the hypotheses in property tests

The aim of this paper is to investigate the potential of property-based testing which allows to directly express model-specifications in code and test them. 

main message: testing of functional abs is easier due to composability and controlled side effects. also property-based testing is much more expressive, allowing a specification based testing. 
Contribution: first to look into the potential of property-based testing for agent-based simulation verification.
