\section{Introduction}

In this paper we investigate the potential of property-based testing which allows to directly express model-specifications in code and test them. We use Sugarscape and try to formulate the hypotheses in property tests.
TODO: Build on ivans 2 papers.
TODO: Implement a version working with ivans Haskell titan

main message: testing of functional abs is easier due to composability and controlled side effects. also property-based testing is much more expressive, allowing a specification based testing. 
Contribution: first to look into the potential of property-based testing for agent-based simulation verification.
