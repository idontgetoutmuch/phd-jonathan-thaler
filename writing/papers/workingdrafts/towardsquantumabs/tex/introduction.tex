\section{Introduction}
TODO: in recent years quantum computing has found its way from the science labs to home computers of scientists. Altenkirch et al have developed a Quantum monad, which allows simulating of quantum computing on a classical machine. Microsoft recently released Q\# which also allows to write programs for quantum computing and IBM released their cloud-based quantum computing framework, which can be also run on their quantum computer.

TODO: The aim of this paper is to investigate if and how agent-based simulation can be mapped to quantum computing and what the benefits and drawbacks are.

TODO: The contributions of this paper are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item It describes for the first time how agents in agent-based simulation can be mapped to quantum computing, what the benefits are
	\item As computing language it uses Q\#
\end{itemize}

TODO: structure of the paper (describe what each section does)
