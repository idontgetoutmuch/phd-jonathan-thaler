\begin{abstract}
As Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is still a young discipline we argue that it has still a bright future ahead. We claim that its logical future is to simulate our own world, thus creating a point where simulation and reality converge, an event we postulate and term \textit{Simulation-Convergence}. Just by being able to talk about this convergence hints that there may be strong connections between the real world and ABS. As we will show the only really interesting and worthy reason for pursuing the \textit{Simulation-Convergence} is to simulate free will. We argue that the emergent properties of such a simulation of the free will are ideologies - mechanisms for restricting free will. We hypothesize that the \textit{Simulation-Convergence} may already have happened and that reality as we experience it is indeed an ABS created by our very self. This will give us a framework which allows us to talk about metaphysics from a computer-scientific view-point the first time. The remainder of the paper then interprets various metaphysical concepts like birth, death, karma, god, near-death experiences, afterlife, ethics, meditation, spiritual enlightenment, spiritual calling,... in this computer-scientific simulation-of-a-free-will context.
