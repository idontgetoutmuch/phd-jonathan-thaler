\begin{abstract}
As Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is still a young discipline we ask for its future and try to hypothesize in which direction it will develop. We claim that its logical future is to simulate our own world, thus creating a point where simulation and reality converge, an event we postulate and term \textit{Simulation-Convergence}. Just by being able to talk about this convergence hints that there may be strong connections between the real world and ABS - something other simulation tools can hardly claim for themselves. This for the first time will give us a framework which allows us to talk about metaphysics from a computer-scientific view point. As we will show the only really interesting and worthy reason for pursuing the \textit{Simulation-Convergence} is to simulate free will. We argue that the emergent properties of such a simulation of the free will are ideologies. Our final conclusion is that the \textit{Simulation-Convergence} may already have happened and that reality as we experience it is indeed an ABS created by our very self.
