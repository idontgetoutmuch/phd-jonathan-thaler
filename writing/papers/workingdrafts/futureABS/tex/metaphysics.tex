\section{Metaphysics}
The term \textit{Metaphysics} was first coined by Martin Heidegger in "Sein und Zeit" and "Metaphysik". Using our system of reference we can now discuss metaphysics from a computer science perspective: what is the meaning of \textit{to be} (sein), of existence \textit{Das Seiende} and of nothing \textit{das Nichts}. Unfortunately the english language cannot translate these words properly but the basic concepts should be intuitively clear.
