\section{Reality as ABS}
TODO: in this section think about how reality could be implemented as an ABS

simulation of reality may be possible but that computation alone lacks an important ingredient: the spark of conciousness and free will which are inherently non-computable and thus non-constructive. 
Thus => we live in a construced world
But => we ourselves are non-constructive
