\section{Conclusions}

 ] 1984: ultimately it is the aim of the party to remove free will. only in this unfree way, inner peace and bliss may become possible. this is in my opinion the brutal conclusion of the novel (he loves big brother in the end)
[ ] i need to work out why this is exactly so: probably because free will is too powerful for a human to handle. it is too big. with free will fear comes. fear of being alone? this fear is silenced when submitting. why? giving up responsibility for ones own actions. fe
[ ] now applied the deep insight of 1984 into our own world: free will will always lead to destruction. thus it is the aim of all ideologies to remove free will to control the collective from eating each other
[ ] thus ultimately the simulation/experiment of free will fails: it shows that immediately structures emerge which try to control the free will and to submit it into a collective
[ ] this is also true for the right handed path: we give up our free will to a higher good (which is in no way different from any other ideology)
[ ] actually the only way which embraces free will 100\% is the so called left handed path. probably this is also the reason why it has been looked at in deep suspicion ever since humankind's dawn
