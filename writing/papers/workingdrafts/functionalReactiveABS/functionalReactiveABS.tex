[ ] time in FrABS: when 0dt then still actions can occur when not relying on time semantics
[ ] what about time-travel in abms for introspection during running it? this is much easier in FrABS

TODO: also solve the SIR with an algebra system to have a bullet-proof "proof" that we reproduce the same dynamics. this is only partially a proof our system is correct, but it is not a formal proof, this needs to be done different

TODO: don't sell this paper as an opposing view against OOP (e.g. OOP is bad) but as a positive view: "for the first time it is possible to do ABMS in pure functional programming".

TODO: publishing: 1st version write for a journal in the ABMS community, 2nd version write for a conference in the functional programming community e.g. for the TFP in Kent 2018

TODO: It should be possible to formally show that spatial SIR and WildFire are the same model. NOTE: they are NOT the same, the fundamental difference is that in the WildFire model only the burning cells initiate the ignition - if we compare this to the SIR, the burning cells would be infected agents and although in the spatial SIR model the infected agents make contact with other agents, so do the susceptible ones which does NOT occur in wildfire

TODO: cite my own work on update-strategies

TODO: can we formally show that the SIR approximates the SD model?

TODO: cite papers which discuss how to approximate a SD model by ABS
- Macal (2010) - To Agent-Based Simulation From System Dynamics 
	-> i am very unhappy with this paper: first it does not give concrete parameters for the SD model so it is impossible to replicate. Also i think it has a systematical error as the infected agents make no contact but this is required as evident from the SD-models infection-rate which also incorporates. TODO: write an email to this guy: why are the infectious not contacting the other agents? this seems to be a systematical error
- Borshchev, Filippov (2004) - From System Dynamics and Discrete Event to Practical Agent Based Modeling: Reasons, Techniques, Tools
	-> its VERY IMPORTANT point is that we need to draw the illness-duration from an exponential-distribution because the illness-duration is proportional to the size of the infected. note: this is wrongly expressed, need to find the correct formulation

		-> my emulation of SD using ABS is really an implementation of the SD model and follows it - they are equivalent
		-> my ABS implementation is the same as / equivalent to the SD emulation
			=> thus if i can show that my SD emulation is equlas to the SD model
			=> AND that the ABS implementation is the same as the SD emulation
			=> THEN the ABS implementation is an SD implementation, and we have shown this in code for the first time in ABS
			
TODO: the first (of two) contribution of this paper is: an explanation of one way of how ABS can be done in pure functional programming and its benefits: declarative style where the code looks very much like specification, fewer LoC, fewer Bugs, reasoning and proves

TODO: main second contribution is: show that the SD and the ABS implementation of the SIR model are the same by proving that ABS solves the SD equation. this should be possible by now using reasoning techniques (and quickcheck?)

So far, the pure functional paradigm hasn't got much attention in Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) where the dominant programming paradigm is object-orientation, with Java being its most prominent representative. We claim that pure functional programming using Haskell is very well suited to implement complex, real-world ABS. To prove that we implemented the library \textit{FrABMS} which allows to do Agent-Based Modelling \& Simulation the first time in the pure functional programming language Haskell. To achieve this we leverage the basic concepts of ABS with functional reactive programming using the library Yampa. The result is a surprisingly fresh approach to Agent-Based Modelling \& Simulation as it allows to incorporate discrete time-semantics similar to Discrete Event Simulation and continuous time-flows like System Dynamics. In this paper we will show the novel approach of FrABMS through the example of the SIR model and discuss implications and best practices.
