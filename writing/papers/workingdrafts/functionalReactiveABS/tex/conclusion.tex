\section{Conclusion and future research}

put the following into discussion-section

advantages:
	- no side-effects within agents leads to much safer code
	- edsl for time-semantics
	- declarative style
	- sequential and parallel
	- powerful time-semantics
	- arrowized programming is optional and only required when utilizing yampas time-semantics. if the model does not rely on time-semantics, it can use monadic-programming by building on the existing monadic functions in the EDSL which allow to run in the State-Monad which simplifies things very much
	- when to use yampas arrowized programing: time-semantics, simple state-chart agents 
	- when not using yampas facilities: in all the other cases e.g. SugarScape is such a case as it proceeds in unit time-steps and all agents act in every time-step
	
disadvantages:
	- very steep learning curve for non-functional programmers
	- learning a new EDSL
	- think ABMS different: when to use async messages, when to use sync conversations

further research
	- verification \& validation
	- switch to Dunai to allow usage of Monadic programming in the arrows
