\section{Examples}

\subsection{Agent-Based SIR}
Advantage: can incorporate networking or spatial effects. In this example it runs within a discrete 2D environment. FrABMS library also has the ability for networks.

Hypothesis: high-frequency sampling is required when there are rates involved e.g. occacionally.
TODO: compare fully-connected SIR to System Dynamics solution
TODO: look into sequential (shuffled/nonshuffled) vs parallel

\subsection{System Dynamics SIR}
Because we have the powerful time-semantic features of yampa at hand which allows to sample a system at very high frequency with continuous time at hand we can easily implement System Dynamics.
Using parallel iteration-strategy (no shuffling of agents)
Thus in a way we can see FrABMS to be a hybrid approach between ABMS and System Dynamics.

\subsubsection{Stocks}
are completely defined by the formula
InitialValue + Integrate (0 to t) by dt (inflow - outflow)

by messages stocks communicate their current value to the flows which require them.
receive by messages the current vale of all flows relevant to them

\subsubsection{Flows}
Are stateless and can calculate any rate

receive through messages the current values of their relevant Stocks
send their current flow-value to the relevant Stocks
