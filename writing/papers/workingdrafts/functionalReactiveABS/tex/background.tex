\section{Background}

\subsection{Agent Based Simulation}
We understand ABS as a method of modelling and simulating a system where the global behaviour may be unknown but the behaviour and interactions of the parts making up the system is of knowledge. Those parts, called agents, are modelled and simulated out of which then the aggregate global behaviour of the whole system emerges. So the central aspect of ABS is the concept of an agent which can be understood as a metaphor for a pro-active unit, situated in an environment, able to spawn new agents and interacting with other agents in a network of neighbours by exchange of messages \cite{wooldridge_introduction_2009}. It is important to note that we focus our understanding of ABS on a very specific kind of agents where the focus is on communicating entities with individual, localized behaviour from out of which the global behaviour of the system emerges. We informally assume the following about our agents:

\begin{itemize}
	\item They are uniquely addressable entities with some internal state.
	\item They can initiate actions on their own e.g. change their internal state, send messages, create new agents, kill themselves.
	\item They can react to messages they receive with actions as above.
	\item They can interact with an environment they are situated in.
\end{itemize} 

We will give a formal model of agents in a subsequent section (TODO: reference)

\subsection{Related Research}
The amount of research on using the pure functional paradigm using Haskell in the field of ABS has been moderate so far.
Most of the papers look into how agents can be specified using the belief-desire-intention paradigm \cite{de_jong_suitability_2014}, \cite{sulzmann_specifying_2007}, \cite{jankovic_functional_2007}.
A library for Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and System Dynamics (SD) in Haskell called \textit{Aivika 3} is described in \cite{sorokin_aivika_2015}. It comes with very basic features for ABS but only allows to specify simple state-based agents with timed transitions.
\cite{jankovic_functional_2007} discuss using functional programming for discrete event simulation (DES) and mention the paradigm of FRP to be very suitable to DES.

\cite{sulzmann_specifying_2007} present an EDSL for Haskell allowing to specify Agents using the BDI model. TODO: We don't go there, thats not our intention. 

\cite{schneider_towards_2012} and \cite{vendrov_frabjous:_2014} present a domain-specific language for developing functional reactive agent-based simulations. This language called FRABJOUS is very human readable and easily understandable by domain-experts. It is not directly implemented in FRP/Haskell/Yampa but is compiled to Haskell/Yampa code which they claim is also readable. This is the direction we want to head but we don't want this intermediate step but look for how a most simple domain-specific language embedded in Haskell would look like. We also don't touch upon FRP and Yampa yet but leave this to further research for another paper of ours.
