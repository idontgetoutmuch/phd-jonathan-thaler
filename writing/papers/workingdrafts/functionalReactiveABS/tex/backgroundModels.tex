\subsection{Models}
 
\subsubsection{Sugarscape}
\cite{epstein_growing_1996} introduced the famous \textit{Sugarscape} model which is widely researched in the social sciences. TODO: short explanation
We included this model because it is well known and we wanted to test how much effort it takes to implement it with our approach. Because its complexity is moderate and there are only homogeneous agents it allows us to really show the power of our EDSL.

\subsection{ACE Trading World}
\cite{tesfatsion_agent-based_2006} gives a broad overview of agent-based computational economics (ACE), gives the four primary objectives of it and discusses advantages and disadvantages. She introduces a model called \textit{ACE Trading World} in which she shows how an artificial economy can be implemented without the \textit{Walrasian Auctioneer} but just by agents and their interactions. She gives a detailed mathematical specification in the appendix of the paper which should allow others to implement the simulation. We included this model because of its complexity and different, heterogeneous types of agents.
