\section{Background}
In this section we give a short overview of the concepts used throughout the paper.

\subsection{System Dynamics}
In System Dynamics (SD) one models a system through differential equations, allowing to conveniently express continuous systems which change over time \cite{porter_industrial_1962}.  TODO: go more into length

\subsection{Haskell}

\subsection{Functional Reactive Programming}
Functional Reactive Programming is a way to implement systems with continuous and discrete time-semantics in pure functional languages. There are many different approaches and implementations but in our approach we use \textit{Arrowized} FRP \cite{hughes_generalising_2000, hughes_programming_2005} as implemented in the library Yampa \cite{hudak_arrows_2003, courtney_yampa_2003, nilsson_functional_2002}.

The central concept in Arrowized FRP is the Signal Function (SF) which can be understood as a \textit{process over time} which maps an input- to an output-signal. A signal can be understood as a value which varies over time. Thus, signal functions have an awareness of the passing of time by having access to $\Delta t$ which are positive time-steps with which the system is sampled. 

\begin{flalign*}
Signal \, \alpha \approx Time \rightarrow \alpha \\
SF \, \alpha \, \beta \approx Signal \, \alpha \rightarrow Signal \, \beta 
\end{flalign*}

Yampa provides a number of combinators for expressing time-semantics, events and state-changes of the system. They allow to change system behaviour in case of events, run signal functions and generate stochastic events and random-number streams. We shortly discuss the relevant combinators and concepts we use throughout the paper. For a more in-depth discussion we refer to \cite{hudak_arrows_2003, courtney_yampa_2003, nilsson_functional_2002}.

\subsection{Arrowized programming}
Yampa's signal functions are arrows, requiring us to program with arrows. Arrows are a generalisation of monads which, in addition to the already familiar parameterisation over the output type, allow parameterisation over their input type as well \cite{hughes_generalising_2000, hughes_programming_2005}.

In general, arrows can be understood to be computations that represent processes, which have an input of a specific type, process it and output a new type. This is the reason why Yampa is using arrows to represent their signal functions: the concept of processes, which signal functions are, maps naturally to arrows.

There exists a number of arrow combinators which allow arrowized programing in a point-free style but due to lack of space we will not discuss them here. Instead we make use of Paterson's do-notation for arrows \cite{paterson_new_2001} which makes code more readable as it allows us to program with points.

To show how arrowized programming works, we implement a simple signal function, which calculates the acceleration of a falling mass on its vertical axis as an example \cite{perez_testing_2017}.

\begin{HaskellCode}
fallingMass :: Double -> Double -> SF () Double
fallingMass p0 v0 = proc _ -> do
  v <- arr (+v0) <<< integral -< (-9.8)
  p <- arr (+p0) <<< integral -< v
  returnA -< p
\end{HaskellCode}

To create an arrow, the \textit{proc} keyword is used, which binds a variable after which the \textit{do} of Patersons do-notation \cite{paterson_new_2001} follows. Using the signal function \textit{integral :: SF v v} of Yampa which integrates the input value over time using the rectangle rule, we calculate the current velocity and the position based on the initial position \textit{p0} and velocity \textit{v0}. The $<<<$ is one of the arrow combinators which composes two arrow computations and \textit{arr} simply lifts a pure function into an arrow. To pass an input to an arrow, \textit{-<} is used and \textit{<-} to bind the result of an arrow computation to a variable. Finally to return a value from an arrow, \textit{returnA} is used.

TODO: explain that SF are defined for t=0 and then switch into SF' with t Parameter is added
