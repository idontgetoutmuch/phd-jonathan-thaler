\section{Discussion}
We claim that our implementation is correct-by-construction because it is obviously correct because the code \textit{is} the model specification - we have closed the gap between the specification and its implementation. Still we need to verify the dynamics and test the system for its numerical behaviour under varying $\Delta t$.

TODO: argue why it is correct-by-construction, why reproducible guaranteed at compile-time,... support our initial hypothesis and claims from introduction

TODO: integral is the fundamental function
- need to show that it indeed implements the rectangle rule. 
- show that with too large dt we arrive at slightly different results after same time-steps
