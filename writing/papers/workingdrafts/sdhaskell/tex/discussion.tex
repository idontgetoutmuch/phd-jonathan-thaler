\section{Discussion}
TODO: argue why it is correct-by-construction, why reproducible guaranteed at compile-time,... support our initial hypothesis and claims from introduction

TODO: integral is the fundamental function
- need to show that it indeed implements the rectangle rule. 
- show that with too large dt we arrive at slightly different results after same time-steps
- implement a better integral function using better behaved numerical integration
