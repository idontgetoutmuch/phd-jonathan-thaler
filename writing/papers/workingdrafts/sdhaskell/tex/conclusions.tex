\section{Conclusion}
TODO: wow its so super


\section{Further Research}
Obviously the numerical well behaviour depends on the integral function. we showed that for the SIR model and small enough dt, the rectangle rule is enough. Still it might be of benefit if we provide more  sophisticated numerical integration like Runge-Kutta. We leave this for further research.

The key strength of System Dynamic simulation packages is their visual representation which allows non-programmers to express system dynamic models and simulate them. We believe that one can autogenerate Haskell code using our approach to implement System Dynamics from such diagrams but leave this for further research.
