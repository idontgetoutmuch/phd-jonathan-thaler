\section{Introduction}
novelty in our case the use of FRP

We present case-studies in which we employ the well known SugarScape \citep{epstein_growing_1996} and agent-based SIR \citep{macal_agent-based_2010} model to test our hypothesis. The former model can be seen as one of the most influential exploratory models in ABS which laid the foundations of object-oriented implementation of agent-based models. The latter one is an easy-to-understand explanatory model which has the advantage that it has an analytical theory behind it which can be used for verification and validation.

The aim of this paper is: 

This paper makes the following contributions:
- FRP and STM
- compares 3 approaches: non-concurrent, low-level locking, STM

The structure of the paper is:
%In Section \ref{sect:stm_impl} we give a short overview of our implementation, presenting and discussing code. In Section \ref{sect:stm_perf} we present performance comparisons and discuss the implications more in-depth in Section \ref{sect:stm_discussion}. Finally we will give a short outline over further research in \ref{sect:stm_further}.
