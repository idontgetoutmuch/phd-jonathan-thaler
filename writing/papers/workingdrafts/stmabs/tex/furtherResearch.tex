\section{Further Research}
Despite the promising proof-of-concept, still there is more work needed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item So far we only looked at a model which is very well-behaved in STM, leading to a retry ratio of 0. It is of interest to see how STM performs on a model with much more involved read/write patterns e.g. the Sugarscape.
	\item So far we only looked at a time-driven model. It would be of fundamental interest whether we can somehow apply STM and concurrency to an event-driven approach as well. We hypothesise that it is not as striking and easy due to the fundamental sequential approach to even-processing. Generally one could run agents concurrently and undo actions when there are inconsistencies - something which STM supports out of the box.
	\item So far we only looked at asynchronous agent-interactions through TVar and TChan: agents modify the data or send a message but don't synchronise on a reply. Also a receiving agent doesn't do synchronised waiting for messages or data-changes. Still, in some models we need this synchronous way of agent-interactions where agents interact over multiple steps within the same global time-step. We yet have to come up with an easy-to-use solution for this problem using STM.
