\section{Case Study 2: Sugarscape}
the model specification requires to shuffle agents before every step. this happens automatically due to race-conditions in concurrency we arrive at an effectively shuffled processing of agents: we can assume that the order of the agents is \textit{effectively} random in every step - with the important difference, that we dont have control over this randomness as we would have when shuffling.

- main difficulty: synchronous agent-interactions
- STM: not clear yet but retry factor of ~5

TODO: implement Data-Flow between Agents: pure in State and using TChan in STM / IO
TODO: implement Sugarscape IO
TODO: implement Sugarscape TArray
TODO: compare RePast or other Java Sugarscape Performance
