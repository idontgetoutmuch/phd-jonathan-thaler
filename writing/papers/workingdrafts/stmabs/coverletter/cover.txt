- concisely summarize why your paper is a valuable addition to the modeling and simulation field, particularly referring to modeling and simulation methods (see charter of TOMACS);
https://tomacs.acm.org/editorial_charter.cfm

Model Execution: the paper focuses primarily on parallel/concurrent model execution by proposing STM over lock-based approaches to implement ABS
Modeling Methodology: modeling languages as we are using functional programming to implement our case-studies, also STM primitives provide an abstraction over agent-communication which is thus part of modeling methodology
Interplay between other areas of computer science and simulation: we ran our experiments on Amazon EC2 services thus we touch on cloud computing and big data

Our paper experimentally investigates the benefit of using Software Transactional Memory (STM) over lock-based approaches to implement concurrent Agent-Based Simulations (ABS). Our contribution is that to the best of our knowledge we are the first to systematically investigate the use of STM in ABS and compare is performance with sequential, lock-based and imperative implementations both on local and Amazon Cloud Service machinery.

- briefly relate your study to previously published work;
The work \cite{lysenko_framework_2008} discusses a framework which allows to map Agent-Based Simulations to Graphics Processing Units (GPU). Amongst others they use the SugarScape model \cite{epstein_growing_1996} and scale it up to millions of agents on very large environment grids. They reported an impressive speed-up of a factor of 9,000. Although their work is conceptually very different we can draw inspiration from their work in terms of performance measurement and comparison of the SugarScape model.
