\section{Introduction}
In this paper we investigate how agent-based simulation can be approach from a pure functional direction using the programming language Haskell. So far no in-depth research has been conducted on this subject because so far agent-based simulation was always thought of as being best implemented in object-oriented languages like C++, Java and Python. 
As will become apparent throughout this paper, a pure functional approach needs to approach various concepts of ABS very different which leads to a very different approach to ABS but makes concepts which where blurred and implicit very explicit and clear.
This papers major contribution is that it reveals these implicit concept and provides a formal view on ABS and a pure functional implementation of these concepts.
