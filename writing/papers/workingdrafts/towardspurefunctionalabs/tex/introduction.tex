\section{Introduction}
In this paper we investigate how agent-based simulation can be approach from a pure functional direction using the programming language Haskell. So far no in-depth research has been conducted on this subject because so far agent-based simulation was always thought of as being best implemented in object-oriented languages like C++, Java and Python. 
As will become apparent throughout this paper, a pure functional approach needs to approach various concepts of ABS very different which leads to a very different approach to ABS but makes concepts which where blurred and implicit very explicit and clear.
This papers major contribution is that it reveals these implicit concept and provides a formal view on ABS and a pure functional implementation of these concepts.

general requirements to ABS 
- only rely on past
	-> solved with Arrowized FRP
- no bugs due to implicitly mutable state
	-> can be ensured by pure functional programming
- ruling out external sources of non-determinism / randomness
	-> can be ensured by pure functional programming
- correct interaction protocols between agents
	-> can be ensured by dependent state machines
- deterministic time-delta
	-> TODO: can we ensure it through dependent-types at type-level?
- repeated runs lead to same dynamics 
	-> can be ensured by pure functional programming
=> all these can be guaranteed at compile time with pure \& dependently typed functional programming
