\section{Introduction}

what if it calls the same MSF it is currently in? its recursion

Main message: method-call emulation in functional programming
contribution: propose mechanisms to achieve this in a clean way in a Monadic FRP implementation like Dunai

discuss rolling back of actions which is easy with yampa SF but not possible in general in a MSF due to monadic side-effects
limits of recursive interactions?
