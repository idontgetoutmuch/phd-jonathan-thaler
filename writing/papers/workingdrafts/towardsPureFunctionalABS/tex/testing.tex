\section{Testing}

TODO: property-based and unit testing of a model

TODO: modular testing of agents

TODO: reasoning about dynamics in code would allow us to cut substantial calculations: can make assumptions about dynamics without actually running it. is it even possible?

\cite{perez_testing_2017}

\subsection{Time-Traveling}

\cite{perez_back_2017}

[ ] time in FrABS: when 0dt then still actions can occur when not relying on time semantics
[ ] what about time-travel in abms for introspection during running it? this is much easier in FrABS

\subsection{Reasoning}
i need to get a deep understanding in writing correct code and reasoning about correctness in Haskell - look into papers:
