TODO: SIR dynamics using SD with FrABS, using 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 and 0.01 sampling 
TODO: SIR dynamics using ABS with FrABS, using 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 and 0.05 sampling with 1000 agents

TODO: need to do the same thing as AnyLogic. maybe the problem is sampling as well as replications as number of agents, which leaves us in a pretty bad shape performance wise.
	-> how many agents? are 1000 enough?
	-> how many replications? are 32 enough?
	-> what is the sampling interval? 0.1 enough or do we have to go below?
	
	1000 agents with 16 replications and 0.05 dt seems to deliver pretty good results
