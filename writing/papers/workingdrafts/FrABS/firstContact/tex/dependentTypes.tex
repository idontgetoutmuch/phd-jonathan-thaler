\section{The final step: Dependent Types}
Dependent Types are the holy grail in functional programming as they allow to express even stronger guarantees about the correctness of programs and go as far where programs become constructive proofs. Thus the logical final step is to apply them to our pure functional approach to agent-based simulation.
So far no research for applying dependent types to agent-based simulation exists at all and it is not clear whether dependent types do make sense in this setting.
In this section we explore this for the first time and ask more specifically how we can add dependent types to our pure functional agent-based simulation approach, which conceptual implications this has for ABS and what we gain from doing so.
