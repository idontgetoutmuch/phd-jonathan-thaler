% TODO: start with simulating epidemics and then go into ABS
In this paper we derive a pure functional approach for agent-based simulation in Haskell. We start from a very simple solution running in the Random Monad, then making the transition to Yampa 

The aim of this paper is to show how ABS can be done in Haskell and what the benefits and drawbacks are. We do this by introducing the SIR model of epidemiology and derive an agent-based implementation for it based on Functional Reactive Programming. By doing this we give the reader a good understanding of what ABS is, what the challenges are when implementing it and how we solved these in our approach. We then discuss details which must be paid attention to in our approach and its benefits and drawbacks. The contribution is a novel approach to implementing ABS with powerful time-semantics and more emphasis on specification and possibilities to reason about the correctness of the simulation.
