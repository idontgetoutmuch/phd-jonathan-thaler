TODO: start with simulating epidemics and then go into ABS

Background: Follow the old 1st draft paper:
1. introduce simulating epidemics with the SIR model
2. explain the SIR model 
3. explain agent-based approach 
Implementation: deriving implementations step-by-step 
1. naive implementation without Yampa using the rand-monad 
	advantage: 	first approach, it works, having random-monad is VERY convenient
	drawback: 	time is explicitly available and need to feedback all agent-states into every agent
2. naive yampa implementation
	advantage:	time is implicit
	drawback:	still all agent-states are visible to every agent
3. extended yampa implementation with environment and AgentIn/Out
	advantage:	more general
	drawback:	AgentOut is cumbersome to handle iteratively
4. dunai / bearriver
	advantage:	can have monads AND functional reactive 
	drawback:	?
	
implementing dynamic environment and transactional behaviour can be done most elegantly through STM but need monads, this could provide a perfect motivation using bearriver / dunai 

idea: get rid of env in agent SF alltogether (and in agentdef,/in,/out) and use STM for read/write environment. still need some way for a proactive environment: make environment an agent itself. run all agents parallel and remove sequential updates.
