\section{Conclusions and Further Research}


We barely scratched the surface when discussing the use of dependent types in ABS. In contrast to many dependently typed programs in our approach there is actually an interest and need in running them as only then the dynamics of the simulation unfold over time. So far we looked only at how we can ensure the correctness of our mechanisms when using dependent types. It would be of immense interest whether we could apply dependent types also to the model meta-level or not - this boils down to the question if we can encode our model specification in a dependent type way? This would allow the ABS community for the first time to reason about a proper formalisation of a model, something the ABS community hasn't been very fond of so far.
