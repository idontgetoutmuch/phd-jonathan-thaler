TODO: property-based and unit testing of a model

TODO: modular testing of agents

TODO: reasoning about dynamics in code would allow us to cut substantial calculations: can make assumptions about dynamics without actually running it. is it even possible?

-> testing replies: an infected agent always replies with contact infected, a recovered never replies, a susceptible never replies
-> testing contacts: a susceptible contacts occaaionally, an infected contacts occasionally, a recovered never contacts.
-> testing: an infected agent recovering after (same as falling ball?)
-> testing: a susceptible agent gets infected after infect contact
-> testing: can we measure the occasional distribution to verify?
