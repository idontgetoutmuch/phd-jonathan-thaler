\section{Conclusions and Further Research}
Criticism of the FRP approach:
- can lead to infinite loops and needs much care of the programmer who has to consider operational details. This is already visible in the SIR model where we need to be careful to break a potential infinity loop in our simulation stepping. Also the state-machine of the SIR model is quite simple and thus the implementation quite straightforward, for more complex models with more complex e.g. nested state-machines, things will get pretty rough.
- having a two layer (arrows and pure functions) language in Yampa \cite{jeffrey_causality_2013} and three a layer (arrows, monadic and pure functions) language in Dunai / BearRiver adds expressivity and power but can makes things quite complex already in the simple SIR example. Fortunately with a more complex model the complexity in this context does not increase - in the end it is the price we need to pay for this high expressivity like occasionally.

In the light of the promises of dependent types, we can identify weaknesses of our FRP approach. The authors \cite{sculthorpe_safe_2009} show that the type-system of Yampa is not safe as FRP is sacrificing the safety of FP for sake of expressiveness. Amongst others they showed that well-formed feedback does depend on the programmer and cannot be guaranteed at compile time through the type system. Feedback is an inherent feature of ABS where agents update their state at time t+1 depending on time t - this is only visible in step 2 where we used feedback to update the random-number generator (rec/iPre/feedback makes the inherently feedback nature of ABS very explicit) but in more complex ABS models with a more complex state than in the SIR model, feedback is the core feature to keep and update the state of an agent. Also a chain of switches could result in an infinite loop - this cannot be checked at compile time and needs to be carefully designed by the programmer and results sometimes in popping up of operational details (e.g. the need to use $>>> notYet$ in parallel switches for stepping the simulation). 
Another weakness of the approach is that implementing a more complicated agent-transaction protocol correctly can get very challenging. This might not seem directly evident from the implementation in Step 6 but the problem is that there are lots of operational details which the programmer needs to keep in mind and get right to arrive at a correctly working transaction. It would be nice if we have support from the type-system which enforces a given protocol but this is not possible with our approach so far. Note that beside failing to stick to the protocol it is also possible to implement non-total transactions. Note that making the transition from Yampa to the general MSF approach provided by Dunai and BearRiver does not solve this fundamental problem.
We could opt for a re-implementation of FRP in Idris by building on the work of \cite{sculthorpe_safe_2009} and \cite{jeffrey_causality_2013} who have laid out ideas for adopting arrowized FRP to dependent types in Agda \footnote{We have actually found an attempt of implementation of Yampa in Idris on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/BartAdv/idris-yampa} but we haven't tried it and development of the project seems to be inactive since 2 years.}. Unfortunately we would lack Ross Patersons \cite{paterson_new_2001} arrow notation which would force us to program our system in a point-free style which can get quite cumbersome and unreadable if the model to implement is complicated (which is easily the case in ABS). Thus we decide not to follow this road also for the sake of a fresh start, to free us from the FRP background and to see what a fresh approach in dependent types could offer to ABS.

Generally one can say that this pure functional approach is not as superior over traditional object-oriented approaches as one might think at first. There are the single real benefit is the lack of implicit side-effects and reproducibility guaranteed at compile time. The next step would be to make the move to dependent type which would pose a unique benefit over the object-oriented approach and builds on the existing pure functional approach.

Dependent Types are the holy grail in functional programming as they allow to express even stronger guarantees about the correctness of programs and go as far where programs and types become constructive proofs \cite{wadler_propositions_2015} which must be total by definition \cite{thompson_type_1991}, \cite{altenkirch_why_2005}, \cite{altenkirch_pi_sigma:_2010}, \cite{program_homotopy_2013}. Thus the next obvious step is to apply them to our pure functional approach of agent-based simulation. So far no research in applying dependent types to agent-based simulation exists at all and it is not clear whether dependent types do make sense in this setting. We explore this for the first time and ask more specifically how we can add dependent types to our pure functional approach, which conceptual implications this has for ABS and what we gain from doing so. Note that we can only scratch the surface and lay down basic ideas and leave a proper in-depth treatment of this topic for further research. We use Idris \cite{brady_idris_2013}, \cite{brady_type-driven_2017} as language of choice as it is very close to Haskell with focus on real-world application and running programs as opposed to other languages with dependent types e.g. Agda and Coq which serve primarily as proof assistants.

We barely scratched the surface when discussing the use of dependent types in ABS. In contrast to many dependently typed programs in our approach there is actually an interest and need in running them as only then the dynamics of the simulation unfold over time. So far we looked only at how we can ensure the correctness of our mechanisms when using dependent types. It would be of immense interest whether we could apply dependent types also to the model meta-level or not - this boils down to the question if we can encode our model specification in a dependent type way? This would allow the ABS community for the first time to reason about a proper formalisation of a model, something the ABS community hasn't been very fond of so far. Also could we reason about the dynamics in the types e.g. positive/negative feedback?
