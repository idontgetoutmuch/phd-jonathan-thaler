\section{The specification Language}

An Agent A is a 5-tuple <Aid, s, m, e, [tf]>
Aid is the id of the agent
s is the generic state of the agent
m is the message-protocoll the agent understands including the messages (Dt d) and (Terminate)
e is the generic environment the agent acts upon
tf is a transformer-function for every message in the protocol (if an agent wants to ignore the message, it is just the identify function id)

the type of a tf depends on the semantics of the model and there are 4 of them

SEQ: tf :: (A, e) -> (Aid, m) -> (A, e)
PAR: tf :: (A, Global e) -> (Aid, m) -> (A, Local e)
CON: tf :: (A, e) -> (Aid, m) -> STM A
ACT: tf :: (A, e) -> (Aid, m) -> STM A

Local e = e
Global e = Map Aid (Local e)

further the agent has the following functions at its hands
sendMessage :: A -> Aid -> m -> A
