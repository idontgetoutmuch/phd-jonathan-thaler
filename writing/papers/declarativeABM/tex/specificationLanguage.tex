introduce environments: discrete, continuous, graph

An Agent A is a 5-tuple <aid, s, m, tf>
aid is the id of the agent
s is the generic state of the agent
m is the message-protocoll the agent understands 


tf is the transformer-function with the following type Agent -> Event m -> Agent



further there is a function for sending a message to other agents
send :: Agent -> (Aid, m) -> Agent

For calculating one iteration of the system we first pair up all agents with the messages they receive in this iteration and then we step every agent
iteration :: [Agent] -> [Agent]
iteration as = stepAll . collectAll

To pair up every agent with all its receiving messages we collect all messages for each single agent
collectAll :: [Agent] -> [(Agent, [(Aid, m)])]
collectAll as = map (\a -> (a, collectFor a as)) as

To pair up a single Agent with its receiving messages, we go over all agents and collect all messages for this current agent
collectFor :: Agent -> [Agent] -> [(Aid, m)]
collectFor a as = foldl (\acc a' -> acc : collectFrom a' aid) [] as
	where
		aid = Aid a

To collect all messages from an agent for a given receiver we simply filter all messages in the outgoing messagebox for the receiving id and then we map the resulting list by replacing the receiving id with the sending id
collectFrom :: Agent -> Aid -> [(Aid, m)]
collectFrom a rid = map (\ (_, m) -> (sid, m)) ms
	where
		sid = Aid a
		ms = filter (\ (rid', m) -> rid == rid') (mbox a)

To step all agents we simply apply step to all agents-message pairs by using map
stepAll :: [(Agent, [(Aid, m)])] -> [Agent]
stepAll = map step

To step an agent we first clear the message-box of the agent, then let consume it its messages and then advance the time 
step :: (Agent, [(Aid, m)]) -> Agent
step = advanceTime . consumeMessages 

TODO: need to clear the message-box but then the elegant function.composition breaks down but this is probably the most elegant play where to do it

Consuming th messages means starting with the initial agent applying the transformation-function for each message resulting in a new agent in every message
consumeMessages :: (Agent, [(Aid, m)]) -> Agent
consumeMessages (a, ms) = foldl tf a ms
	where
		tf = (tf a)

To advance time we simply send the Dt message with the time-step delta to the tranformer-function
advanceTime :: Agent -> Agent
advanceTime a = tf a (-1, Dt 1.0)
	where
		tf = (tf a)
