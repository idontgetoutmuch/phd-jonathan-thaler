TODO: select a suitable model simulating an economy 

As example we select the Agent-Based Model from the Book \cite{darley_nasdaq_2007} which is a model of the NASDAQ market from the year around 2001. Although the market itself has changed considerately some fundamentals are still in place and haven't changed. Our goal is to see whether we can rebuild this complex model with heterogenous Agents using Yampa in Haskell. \\
