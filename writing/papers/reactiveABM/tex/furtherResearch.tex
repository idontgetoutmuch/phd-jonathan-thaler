\section{Further Research}

\subsection{Updated Model}
The next steps would then be to update the model to reflect the current details of the NASDAQ stock-market.

\subsection{Batch Auctions}
The paper \cite{budish_editors_2015} looked into utilizing batch-auctions as a remedy against High-Frequency-Trading and shows that it does work analytically. Although there exists an ABS (TODO: Wah, Elaine, and Michael Wellman. 2013. “Latency Arbitrage, Market Fragmentation, and
Efficiency: A Two-Market Model.” 14th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, June.) it is more theoretical and it would be interesting to see how one could incorporate this extension in this more realistic framework.
