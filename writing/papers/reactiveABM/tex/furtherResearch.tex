\section{Further Research}

\subsection{Updated Model}
The next steps would then be to update the model to reflect the current details of the NASDAQ stock-market.

\subsection{Batch Auctions}
The paper \cite{budish_editors_2015} looked into utilizing batch-auctions as a remedy against High-Frequency-Trading and shows that it does work analytically. Although there exists an ABS \cite{wah_latency_2013} it is more theoretical and it would be interesting to see how one could incorporate this extension in this more realistic framework.
