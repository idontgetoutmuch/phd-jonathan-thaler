%TODOs
%	TODO signposting: introduce things more clearly - we do this because...
%	OK we have much more space now: can we bring in sections from the first, too long version?
%	OK do we need all the pictures?
%	OK fix RNG correlation bug and compare dynamics
%		-> it seems that fixing this results in quite different dynamics. Compare dynamics of Random Monad as well: if it comes closer then maybe there is really something wrong with the correlation between the RNGs
%
%	FAIR fix referee comment: "Some entries in the references lack details for finding them without a search engine, e.g. 26, 27, 28. 
%	OK correlation in Yampa version: A) fix it or B) mention that this is actually a problem and simply wrong in Simulation (but not in a game), the next step solves that problem, and leave the bug in as an educational example where functional programming can encourage bugs if not carefully thinking about it	
%	OK dependent types: klarer machen was wir dort wollen (agent-interaction, internal state transitions, safe environment access, totality checking)	
%	OK fix referee comment: In an English text citations should not be nouns (the authors of [x]), they are parenthesised additions. Removing them should leave a readable text. 
%	OK fix referee comment "You often say "The authors of [XY] discuss/present ...". This is bad for two reasons. First of all, numeric references should
%	not be used as a part of the sentence, because the "[XY]" form typographically is an annotation, and also because there's no info conveyed by a number and flipping back and forth is not very nice. Furthermore, it is semantically not what I think you mean. The authors of a given paper may have done a lot of things in their lives, but I think you actually mean that the paper you refer to discusses/presents these things. If you simply name the authors and say "A and B discuss/present ... [XY]", then you avoid both problems.
%	OK Is reference 2 still in preparation, since 2005?"
%	OK performance: ignore as far as possible and only mention in further work
%	OK we started with high hopes: remove completely
%	OK section 4: put into background
%	OK related work vorne lassen
%	OK fix referee comment: Also citations such as [6], [9], [12] should be combined into [6, 9, 12].

%SPACE: reduce supersampling: dont provide yampa function
%SPACE: compress the step to msfs into adding Environment
%SPACE: shorten MSF example in Background
%SPACE: reduce code in paper as well in last step because hardly necessary anymore

Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is a methodology in which a system is simulated in a bottom-up approach by modelling the micro interactions of its constituting parts, called agents, out of which the global system behaviour emerges.

So far mainly object-oriented techniques and languages have been used in ABS. Using the SIR model of epidemiology, which simulates the spreading of an infectious disease through a population, we demonstrate how to use pure Functional Reactive Programming to implement ABS. With our approach we can guarantee the reproducibility of the simulation at compile time and rule out specific classes of run-time bugs, something that is not possible with traditional object-oriented languages. Also, we found that the representation in a purely functional format is conceptually quite elegant and opens the way to formally reason about ABS.
