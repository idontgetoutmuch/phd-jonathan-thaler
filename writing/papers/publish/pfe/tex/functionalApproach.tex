\section{Deriving a pure functional approach}
\label{sec:functional_approach}

In \cite{thaler_art_2017} two fundamental problems of implementing an ABS from a programming-language agnostic point of view is discussed. The first problem is how agents can be pro-active and the second how interactions and communication between agents can happen. For agents to be pro-active, they must be able to perceive the passing of time, which means there must be a concept of an agent-process which executes over time. Interactions between agents can be reduced to the problem of how an agent can expose information about its internal state which can be perceived by other agents. 

Both problems are strongly related to the semantics of a model and the authors show that it is of fundamental importance to match the update-strategy with the semantics of the model - the order in which agents are updated and actions of agents are visible can make a big difference and need to match the model semantics. The authors identify four different update-strategies, of which the \textit{parallel} update-strategy matches the semantics of the agent-based SIR model due to the underlying roots in the System Dynamics approach. In the parallel update-strategy, the agents act \textit{conceptually} all at the same time in lock-step. This implies that they observe the same environment state during a time-step and actions of an agent are only visible in the next time-step - they are isolated from each other, see Figure \ref{fig:parallel_strategy}.

Also, the authors \cite{thaler_art_2017} have shown the influence of different deterministic and non-deterministic elements in ABS on the dynamics and how the influence of non-determinism can completely break them down or result in different dynamics despite same initial conditions. This means that we want to rule out any potential source of non-determinism, which we achieve by keeping our implementation pure. This rules out the use of the IO Monad and thus any potential source of non-determinism under all circumstances because we would lose all compile time guarantees about reproducibility. Still we will make use of the Random Monad, which indeed allows side-effects but the crucial point here is that we restrict side-effects only to this type in a controlled way without allowing general unrestricted effects like in traditional object-oriented approaches in the field.

In the following, we derive a pure functional approach for an ABS of the SIR model in which we pose solutions to the previously mentioned problems. We start out with a first approach in Yampa and show its limitations. Then we generalise it to a more powerful approach, which utilises Monadic Stream Functions, a generalisation of FRP. Finally we add a structured environment, making the example more interesting and shows the real strength of ABS over other simulation methodologies like System Dynamics and Discrete Event Simulation \footnote{The code of all steps can be accessed freely through the following URL: \url{https://github.com/thalerjonathan/phd/tree/master/public/purefunctionalepidemics/code}}.

\subsection{Additional Steps}
ABS involves a few more advanced concepts which we don't fully explore in this paper due to lack of space. Instead we give a short overview and discuss them without presenting code or going into technical details.

\subsubsection{Synchronous Agent Interactions}
Synchronous agent interactions are necessary when an arbitrary number of interactions between two agents need to happen instantaneously within the same time-step. The use-case for this are price negotiations between multiple agents where each pair of agents needs to come to an agreement in the same time-step \cite{epstein_growing_1996}. In object-oriented programming, the concept of synchronous communication between agents is implemented directly with method calls.

We have implemented synchronous interactions in an additional step. We solved it pure functionally by running the signal functions of the transacting agent pair as often as their protocol requires but with $\Delta t=0$, which indicates the instantaneous character of these interactions.

\subsubsection{Event Scheduling}
Our approach is inherently time-driven where the system is sampled with fixed $\Delta t$. The other fundamental way to implement an ABS in general, is to follow an event-driven approach \cite{meyer_event-driven_2014}, which is based on the theory of Discrete Event Simulation \cite{zeigler_theory_2000}. In such an approach the system is not sampled in fixed $\Delta t$ but advanced as events occur, where the system stays constant in between. Depending on the model, in an event-driven approach it may be more natural to express the requirements of the model.

In an additional step we have implemented a rudimentary event-driven approach, which allows the scheduling of events. Using the flexibility of MSFs we added a State transformer to the monad stack, which allows queuing of events into a priority queue. The simulation is advanced by processing the next event at the top of the queue, which means running the MSF of the agent which receives the event. The simulation terminates if there are either no more events in the queue or after a given number of events, or if the simulation time has advanced to some limit. Having made the transition to MSFs, implementing this feature was quite straight forward, which shows the power and strength of the generalised approach to FRP using MSFs.

%\subsubsection{Dynamic Agent creation}
%In the SIR model, the agent population stays constant - agents don't die and no agents are created during simulation - but some simulations \cite{epstein_growing_1996} require dynamic agent creation and destruction. We can easily add and remove agents signal functions in the recursive switch after each time-step. The only problem is that creating new agents requires unique agent ids but with the transition to MSFs we can add a monadic context, which allows agents to draw the next unique agent id when they create a new agent. 

\subsubsection{Conflicts in Environment}
The semantics of the agent-based SIR model allowed a straight-forward implementation of the parallel update-strategy. This is not easily possible when there could be conflicts in the environment e.g. moving agents where only a single one can occupy a cell. Most models in ABS \cite{epstein_growing_1996} solve this by implementing a sequential update-strategy \cite{thaler_art_2017}, where agents are run after another but can already observe the changes by agents run before them in the same time-step. To prevent the introduction of artefacts due to a specific ordering, these models shuffle the agents before running them in each step to average the probability for a specific agent to be run at a fixed position.

A \textit{sequential} update-strategy does not map naturally do functional programming because in it the focus is primarily on a data-parallel approach, which is enforced by the fundamental different nature of side-effects and the immutability of data. Thus, in such a model, different conflict resolving mechanisms need to be implemented. One approach is to randomly select a winner and re-run other conflicting agents signal functions as long as the underlying monadic context is robust to re-runs - in case of the Random Monad this would be no problem.
