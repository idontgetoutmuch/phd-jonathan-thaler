\section{Conclusion and future research}
In this paper we have presented general properties of ABS, derived four general update-strategies and discussed their implications. By doing this we proposed a unified terminology which allows to speak about update-strategies in a common and unified way, something that the ABS community is currently lacking. We hope our classification and terminology will help the community to better understand the details necessary to consider implementing an agent based simulation. Again we cannot stress enough that selecting the right update-strategy is of most importance and must match the semantics of the model one wants to simulate.
We showed that the \textit{Prisoners Dilemma} game on a 2D-grid can only be simulated correctly when using the \textit{parallel strategy} and that the other strategies lead to a break-down of the emergent pattern reported in the original paper. On the other hand using the \textit{Heroes \& Cowards} game we showed that there exist models whose emergent patterns exhibit a stability under varying update-strategies. Intuitively we can say that this is due to the nature of the model specification which does not require specific orderings of actions but it would be interesting to put such intuitions on firm theoretical grounds.
