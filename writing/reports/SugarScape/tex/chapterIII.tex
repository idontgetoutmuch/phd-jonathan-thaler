\subsection{Secual Reproduction}
I was unable to reproduce the Figure III-1, it seems completely unrealistic. Also it contradicts Animation III-2, which looks pretty much like my run: we know that the 2d space is 50x50 = 2500 cells. Now we can roughly estimate that in Animation III-2 Picture 6 the 2d space is covered for more than 50\% which would result in at least 1250 Agents alive. This clearly contradicts the Figure III-1. Also when thinking about it Figure III-1 seems not realistic as there will be about as many agents to cover both sugar-hills except the lowest region of level 1. This is due to the fact that this seems to be enough to sustain them and also they wont move much and just harvest whats there thus accumulating ever increasing wealth and thus being able to mate and give birth to new children. Thus my conclusion: a more realistic value is about 1500 Agents which stays pretty constant.
