\section{Part III: Phd Research} 
The central aspect of my PhD is the question of \textit{How can Agent-Based Simulation be done using pure functional programming and what are the benefits and disadvantages of it?}.

[ ] apply to bilateral trading
[ ] apply to artificial economies (probably too complicated?)
[ ] todo: implement functional reactive abs (FrABS)
[ ] todo: define an EDSL for FrABS which is at the same time model specification- and implementation-language
[ ] todo: define semantics of FrABS based on semantics of FRP and Actors
[ ] what is emergence and can we reason about it? 
[ ] identify emergent properties: equilibrium, behaviour on macroscale not defined on micro, chaos,...
[ ] if yes can we reason about it in advance or only after having run the simulation and identified emergent properties?
[ ] in other words: can emergence be formalized? if yes how far?
[ ] what is the relation between emergence and computation? we need change over time (=computation) for emergence
[ ] baas 1994: emergence, hierarchies and hyperstructures
[ ] introduce MetaABS (also implement it in the EDSL), try to reason about its application to SugarScape and compare results
[ ] until 1st year report (july): basic implementation of FrABS, literature research about emergence, basic study of MetaABS, reasoning about H&C cross patterns, writing 1st year report
[ ] until end of 1st year (sept): fully implement FrABS with EDSL, completely implement sugarscape

\subsection{Research Questions}
\paragraph{Main} 

\subsection{Main contributions to knowledge}
[ ] ABS/M is possible in functional programming by development of FrABS
[ ] An EDSL and its semantics for model specification in FrABS where spec = code,  no need for explicit verification
[ ] Novel concept which is very natural enabled through FrABS: MetaABS, running locally-recursive simulations
[ ] Reasoning about  dynamics and emergent properties of ABS based on EDSL and its semantics in the context of decentralized bartering

\subsection{Planned Papers}
[ ] paper A: FrABS - an EDSL and its semantics for ABS where the EDSL = spec = code
[ ] paper B: MetaABS using FrABS
[ ] paper C: reasoning about dynamics and emergent properties of ABS usibg FrABS
