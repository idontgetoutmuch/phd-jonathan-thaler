\section{Part II: Literature}

\subsection{Economics and Agent-Based Computational Economics}
\cite{tesfatsion_agent-based_2006} gives a broad overview of agent-based computational economics (ACE), gives the four primary objectives of it and discusses advantages and disadvantages. She introduces a model called \textit{ACE Trading World} in which she shows how an artificial economy can be implemented without the \textit{Walrasian Auctioneer} but just by agents and their interactions. She gives a detailed mathematical specification in the appendix of the paper which should allow others to implement the simulation.

\subsection{Social Simulation}
The SugarScape model \cite{epstein_growing_1996} is one of the most influential models of agent-based simulation in the social sciences. The book heavily promotes object-oriented programming (note that in 1996 oop was still in its infancy and not yet very well understood by the mainstream software-engineering industry). We ask how it can be done using pure functional programming paradigm and what the benefits and limits are. We hypothesize that our solution will be shorter (original reported 20.000 LOC), can make use of EDSL thus making it much more expressive, can utilize QuickCheck for a completely new dimension of model-checking and debugging and allows a very natural implementation of MetaABS (see Part III) due to its recursive and declarative nature.
