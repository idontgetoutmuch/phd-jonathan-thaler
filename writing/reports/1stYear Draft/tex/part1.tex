How can ABS/M be done in pure functional programming Haskell? Is it convenient? Are there special benefits / disadvantages to it? 

- start with suitability of haskel / pure functional paradigm as implementation for ABS: take the programming paradigm paper for that.
- extend section on Haskell with implementation details (no direct method/function call, parallelism, concurrency)
- add special section on STM because its a killer-feature for concurrent ABS in Haskell
- section on update-strategies following my submitted paper
- EDSL for Functional Reactive ABS/M
- model checking and reasoning by quickcheck: \cite{claessen_quickcheck:_2000}, \cite{hutton_tutorial_1999}
