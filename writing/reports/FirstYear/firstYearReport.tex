%A succinct and concise summary (250 words maximum) of the report contents and presented on a single page.

So far specifying Agent-Based Models and implementing them as an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is done using object-oriented methods like UML and object-oriented  programming languages like Java. The reason for this is that until now the concept of an agent was always understood to be very close to, if not equals to - which it is not - the concept of an object. Therefore, the reasoning goes, object-oriented methods and languages should apply naturally to specify and implement agent-based simulations. In this thesis we fundamentally challenge this assumption by investigating how Agent-Based Models and Simulations (ABS) can be specified and implemented using pure functional methods and what the benefits are. 
We show how ABS can be implemented in the pure functional language Haskell and develop a basic underlying theoretical framework in Category-Theory and Type-Theory which allows to view and specify ABS from a new point-of-view. Having these tools at hand the major benefit using them is the potential for an unprecedented approach to validation \& verification of an ABS. First: due to the declarative nature of pure functional programming in Haskell it is possible to implement an EDSL for ABS which ideally results in code which is equals to specification thus closing the gap between specification and implementation. Second: validation becomes possible by formulating hypotheses directly in code using the EDSL and QuickCheck and then verify these hypotheses. Third: Category-Theory allows to view ABS from a high-level view thus giving a different insight and allows to specify ABM in a new way.
