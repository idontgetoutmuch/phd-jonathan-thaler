%A succinct and concise summary (250 words maximum) of the report contents and presented on a single page.

So far specifying Agent-Based Models and implementing them as an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is done using object-oriented methods like UML and object-oriented  programming languages like Java. The reason for this is that until now the concept of an agent was always understood to be very close to, even equals to - which it is not - the concept of an object. Therefore, the reasoning goes, object-oriented methods and languages should apply naturally to specify and implement agent-based simulations. In this thesis we fundamentally challenge this assumption by investigating how Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABS) can be done using pure functional methods. 
We show how ABS can be implemented in the pure functional language Haskell and develop a basic underlying theoretical framework in category-theory which allows to view and specify ABS from a new point-of-view. Having these tools at hand the major benefit using them is the potential for an unprecedented approach to validation \& verification of an ABS. First: due to the declarative nature of pure functional programming in Haskell it is possible to implement an EDSL for ABS which is both specification- and implementation-language thus closing the gap between model-specification and implementation. Second: by extracting a category-theoretical view on a real-world example and showing that the pure functional code is actually an implementation of this category-theoretical view allows a new, formal approach to validation.
