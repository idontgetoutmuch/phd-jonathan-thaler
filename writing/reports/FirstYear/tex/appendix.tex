%Material that is complementary to the main body of the report can be included in an appendix. For externally sponsored students, if a report has been submitted to the sponsor during the year of the review, the report should be included in the appendix (a copy of the report can be supplied by the PGR coordinator). The appendix should include a list of training courses (including dates, duration, etc.) taken by the student during the year and other relevant research activities such as given seminars, attendance and presentations to conferences, etc. The appendix could also include material that is supplementary to the main body of the report such as: description of data sets, detailed experimental results, papers that have been submitted or published, etc.

\chapter{Update-Strategies}
TODO: write short explanation of this paper: tries to develop foundational technical vocabulary for ABS.

\includepdf[pages=-]{./pdf/iteratingABM.pdf}

\chapter{Programming-paradigms in ABS}
TODO: write short explanation of this paper. emphasize that it was not published but originally part of the update-strategies paper which was then split because of two different things mixed up.

\includepdf[pages=-]{./pdf/programmingParadigmsABS.pdf}

\chapter{Recursive ABS}
TODO: write short explanation of this paper. not published but interesting idea but not enough time to pursue. also why stopped working: don't have the right model in which it serves as a killer-features. still we are convinced that it proves one of the major benefits of FrABS: recursion is easy to implement because the language is built on it and due to the lack of side-effects.

TODO: include, need little bit of refinement: put in the pictures of dynamics
