\subsection{Work To Date}

\subsubsection{Papers}
\paragraph{Update-Strategies in ABS}
A foundational paper
TODO: attach as appendix 

\paragraph{Programming Paradigms and ABS}
In this work I investigated the suitability of three fundamentally different programming pardigms to implement an ABS. The paradigms I looked at was object-oriented using Java, pure functional using Haskell and multi-paradigm functional using Scala with the Actors library. It is important to note that at this point I didn't use FRP as underlying paradigm in Haskell TODO: would this have changed my final conclusion on its suitability?

STM: the really unique thing which is ONLY possible in pure functional programming is composition of concurrency. TODO: cite Tim Sweeny
Actors in Scala

\subsubsection{Software}
Lots of prototyping:
Heroes \& Cowards, SIRS \& Schelling Segregation in Java, Haskell and Scala
Parallelism and Concurrency in Haskell

FrABS: SugarScape Model as use-case no.1. TODO: available on github
