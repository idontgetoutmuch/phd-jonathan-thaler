\section{Work To Date}
TODO: Describe the research work carried out during this stage of the PhD and the outcomes. A literature review must be included. Then, as appropriate according to the PhD project, this section can also include theoretical and/or experimental methods, presentation and discussion of results, etc. In the case that papers have been submitted or published within the year of the review, this section can be shorter and focused on discussing the outcomes from those papers within the wider context of the PhD programme of study (papers to be included in the appendix).


\subsection{Papers Submitted}
\paragraph{Update-Strategies in ABS}
TODO: attach as appendix

A foundational paper

\subsection{Paper Drafts}
\paragraph{Programming Paradigms and ABS}
TODO: attach as appendix

In this work I investigated the suitability of three fundamentally different programming pardigms to implement an ABS. The paradigms I looked at was object-oriented using Java, pure functional using Haskell and multi-paradigm functional using Scala with the Actors library. It is important to note that at this point I didn't use FRP as underlying paradigm in Haskell TODO: would this have changed my final conclusion on its suitability?

STM: the really unique thing which is ONLY possible in pure functional programming is composition of concurrency. TODO: cite Tim Sweeny
Actors in Scala

\subsubsection{Papers in Progress}
\paragraph{Recursive ABS}

\paragraph{Functional Reactive ABS}

\subsubsection{Software}
Lots of prototyping:
Heroes \& Cowards, SIRS \& Schelling Segregation in Java, Haskell and Scala
Parallelism and Concurrency in Haskell

FrABS: SugarScape Model as use-case no.1. TODO: available on github
