\chapter{Aims and Objectives}
\label{chap:aimsObj}

This chapter gives a compact and concise overview of the aims and objectives. Chapter \ref{chap:future} gives a more in-depth plan and details in how we will approach the aim in general and the objectives in particular.

\section{Aim}
The aim of this Ph.D. is to explore the benefits and drawbacks of the pure functional programming paradigm in Agent-Based Simulations. 

\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement a library for general-purpose Agent-Based Simulation in Haskell to have a tool which is a concrete instance of the pure functional programming paradigm to be used conducting the research on this paradigm.

	\item Compare the general approach of pure functional programming in the instance of Haskell and object-oriented programming in the instance of Java to implement ABS. Look into differences and similarities and identify benefits and drawbacks.

	\item Explore how pure functional programming can increase robustness, testability, verification and correctness of Agent-Based Simulations.

	\item Investigate to which extent one can use reasoning-techniques of the pure functional paradigm to reason about dynamics in ABS.
