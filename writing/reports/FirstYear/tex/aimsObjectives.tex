\chapter{Aims and Objectives}

- developing a category- \& type-theoretical view on Agent-Based Modelling \& Simulation which will 
	-> 1. give a deeper insight into the structure of agents, agent-models and agent-based simulation
	-> 2. serves as the basis for the pure functional implementation
	-> 3. serves as a high-level specification tool for agent-models

- implementing a library called FrABS based upon the FRP paradigm which allows to specify Agent-Based Models in an EDSL and run them

- Verification: closing the gap between specification and implementation through the category- \& type-theoretical view and the EDSL

- Validation: formalizing hypotheses and reasoning about dynamics and expected outcomes of the simulation

Define 5 general research questions for each Research-Context
	\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 related to FP
    \item 1 related to integration of FP to ABM/S
    \item 2 related to ABM/S
    \end{itemize}
    
\subsection{Validation}
Semantics for FrABS and our EDSL to reason about the results: are they reasonable? do they match the theory? if yes why? if not why not?
	- Can we define semantics for the EDSL to do reasoning about ABS in general?
	- How can we reason about ABS in general in pure functional programming?
		- dynamics
		- emergent properties
		- deadlocks
		- silence (no messages/agent-agent communication and interaction)
		- define semantics of FrABS based on semantics of FRP and Actors
		- what is emergence in ABS and how can we reason about it? 
			- identify emergent properties: equilibrium, behaviour on macroscale not defined on micro, chaos,...
			- can we anticipate emergent properties / dynamics just by looking at the code and reason about it?
			- can emergence in ABS be formalized?
				- hypothesis: it may be possible through functional programming because of its dual nature of declarative EDSL which awakens to a process during computation
					- what is the relation between emergence and computation? we need change over time (=computation) for emergence
					
		- Can we reason about the dynamics and equilibria of agent-based models of decentralized bilateral trading \& bartering?
