\section{Aims and Objectives}

- developing a category- \& type-theoretical view on Agent-Based Modelling \& Simulation which will 
	-> 1. give a deeper insight into the structure of agents, agent-models and agent-based simulation
	-> 2. serves as the basis for the pure functional implementation
	-> 3. serves as a high-level specification tool for agent-models

- implementing a library called FrABS based upon the FRP paradigm which allows to specify Agent-Based Models in an EDSL and run them

- Verification: closing the gap between specification and implementation through the category- \& type-theoretical view and the EDSL

- Validation: formalizing hypotheses and reasoning about dynamics and expected outcomes of the simulation
