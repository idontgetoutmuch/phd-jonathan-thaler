TODO:
- Why ACE and Social Simulation? Did i only pick these fields because they are easily applicable to the problems I want to solve? Which properties do they exhibit which make them interesting for my problem? Just to say that "Sugarscape and bilateral decentralized bartering is interesting and fascinates me" is not enough in a final viva/thesis/paper.	

\section{Aims}
The aim of this Ph.D is to explore the benefits and drawbacks using Haskell in implementing Agent-Based Simulations. First a library for general-purpose ABS in Haskell is built which serves as the primary object to study the benefits and drawbacks. After, the library will be used to research verification and reasoning in ABS in the context of decentralized bilateral bartering as occuring in the Sugarscape model.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement a library for general-purpose Agent-Based Simulation in Haskell 
	\item Compare the usage of Haskell in ABS to the usage of Java and other implementation techniques in ABS: what are the benefits/drawbacks of Haskell and what are the benefits/drawbacks of Java? Are they orthogonal to each other e.g. are the weaknesses of one language the other languages strength?

	\item Develop reasoning-techniques using Functional Programming in ABS by comparing the implementations of the SD- and ABS-model of the SIR compartment model in epidemiology.
	\item Apply reasoning to the bilateral decentralized bartering process in the Sugarscape model and find out how far reasoning can be utilized and to what extent one can reason about e.g. equilibrium and dynamics in a pure functional ABS and if it is possible at all.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which is the best / a valid / good working approach of implementing ABS in Haskell?
	\item What are the benefits of using Haskell in ABS?
	\item What are the drawbacks of using Haskell in ABS?
	\item Are there things which are unique when doing Haskell in ABS and cannot be done in a Java approach?
	\item Both the System-Dynamics and Agent-Based implementation of the SIR compartment model in epidemiology lead to the same dynamics or put different: the Agent-Based implementation shows the same dynamics of the SD implementation when using replications. This is shown by plotting the dynamics as graphs. Can we show that they are equivalent through reasoning about the code?
	\item In the Sugarscape model where Agents engage in bilateral decentralized bartering Equilibrium is only reached when neo-classical agents are used which don't die of natural age. The equilibrium is not reached when more realistic assumptions are made. This is shown by plotting the prices over time. Can we show that the equilibrium is reached / not reached when using neo-classical agents / realistic agents through reasoning in the code?
	\item What and to which extent can we reason about an Agent-Based Simulation using my implementation in Haskell?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hypotheses}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Yampa is a valid / good approach of implementing ABS in Haskell.
	\item Haskell benefits (which are not possible in java) are: Code == Spec, can statically rule out a major and very relevant class of bugs, can perform reasoning and proofing of properties of the program
	\item Haskell drawbacks over java are: slower, potential for difficult to find space-leaks, much more difficult to reason about performance in general, steeper learning curve, think ABS different 
	\item reproducibility of a system: lack of unpredictable side-effects statically enforced in the type-system
\end{enumerate}
