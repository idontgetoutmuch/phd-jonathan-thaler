\chapter{Aims and Objectives}
\label{chap:aimsObj}

In this chapter we derive the hypotheses to the motivating questions from the introduction based upon our literature-review and present our aims and objectives for our PhD. We present research-questions and hypotheses.

\section{Aims}
The pure functional programming language Haskell offers all the required features. Together with the concept of functional reactive programming (FRP) we will show that ABS becomes very well possible to be implemented in a functional language. The declarative nature of Haskell allows us to implement an embedded domain-specific language (EDSL) for ABS based on the FRP paradigm.

To do verification we need a form of formal specification which can be translated easily to the code. Being inspired by the previously mentioned work on a functional framework for agent-based models of exchange in \cite{botta_functional_2011} we opt for a similar direction. Having Haskell as the implementation language instead of an object-oriented one like Java allows us to build on the above proposed EDSL for ABS. Because of the declarative nature of the hypothesized EDSL it can act both as specification- and implementation-language which closes the gap between specification and implementation. This would give us a way of formally specifying the model but still in a more readable way than pure mathematics. This form of formal specification can act easily as a medium for communication between team-memberes and to the scientific audience in papers. Most important the explicit step of verification becomes obsolete as there exists no more difference between specification and implementation. The last point seems to be quite ambitious but this is a hypothesis and we will see in the course of the thesis how far we can close the gap in the end with this approach.

we propose a new tool for implementing, testing, verifying and validating ABS: the one of pure functional programming and its underlying theory which we together will term \textit{pure functional methods}. We claim that these methods are the answer to the questions posed above and will reduce or even elimiate the danger of failure considerably as outlined in the hypotheses. 
Of course our motivation is not only to improve verification, validation and reproduceability in ABS but also the one of discovery. So far pure functional programming was not really investigated in the context of ABS as will be shown in the literature-review so this thesis is also a proof-of-concept, an investigation how ABS can be done in a pure functional language.

The central aspect of this thesis is centred around the main question of \textit{How Agent-Based Simulation can be done using pure functional programming and what the benefits and disadvantages are.}. So far functional programming has not got much attention in the field of ABS and implementations always focus on the object-oriented approach. We claim, based upon the research of the first year that functional programming is very well suited for ABS and that it offers methods which are not directly possible and only very difficult to achieve with object-oriented programming.

We claim that to build large and complex agent-based simulations in functional programming is possible using the functional reactive programming (FRP) paradigm. We applied FRP to implementing ABS and developed a library in Haskell called FrABS. We implemented the quite complex model SugarScape from social simulation using FrABS and proofed by that, that applying FRP to ABS enables ABS to happen in pure functional programming.

After having shown how agent-based simulation can be done in functional programming we claim that the major benefit of using it enabled a new way of \textit{verification \& validation} in agent-based simulation. 

Due to the declarative nature of pure functional programming it is an established method of implementing an EDSL to solve a given problem in a specific domain. We followed this approach in FrABS and developed an EDSL for ABS in pure functional programming. Our intention was to develop an EDSL which can be used both as specification- and implementation-language. We show this by specifying all the rules of SugarScape in our EDSL.

Due to the lack of implicit side-effects and the recursive nature of pure functional programming we claim that it is natural to apply it to a novel method we came up with: MetaABS, which allows recursive simulation.

Finally having such an EDSL at hand this will allow us to reason about the programs. This will be applied to specify and reason about the dynamics and emergent properties of decentralized bilateral trading and bartering in agent-based computational economics (ACE) and social simulations like SugarScape.

Disadvantages
- although the lack of side-effects is also a benefit, it is also a weakness as all data needs to be passed in and out explicitly 
- indirection due to the lack of objects \& method calls.
- When not to use it: 
	- if you are not familiar with functional programming
	- when you can solve your problem without programming in a Tool like NetLogo, AnyLogic,...
	- when you don't need to reason about your program
	
Functional approach to Agent-Based Modelling \& Simulation
Because we left the path of OO and want to develop a completely different method we have fundamentally two problems to solve in our functional method:
1. Specifying the Agent-Based Model (ABM): Category-Theory, Type-Theory, EDSL: all this clearly overlaps with the  implementation-aspect because the theory behind pure functional programming in Haskell is exactly this. This is a very strong indication that functional programming may be able to really close the gap between specification and implementation in ABS.
2. Implementing the ABM into an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS): building on FRP paradigm

We show that the implicit assumption that an Agent is \textit{about equal to} an object is not correct and leads to many implicit assumptions in OO implementations of an ABS. When implementing ABS in Haskell these implicit assumptions become explicit and challenge the fundamental assumptions about ABS and Agents. We present these implicit assumption in an explicit way by approaching it through programming, type-theory and category-theory to further deepen the concepts and methods in the field of Agent-Based Modelling \& Simulation.

TODO: is it really valid to bind the sending of messages to the advancing of time?
Downside: we cannot have method-calls as in OO, which allows agents to communicate with each other without time advancing. 

Expected benefits
1. By mapping the concepts of ABS to Category-Theory and Type-Theory we gain a deeper understanding of the deeper structure of Agents, Agent-Models and Agent-Simulations.
2. The declarative nature of pure functional programming will allow to close the gap between specification and code by designing an EDSL for ABS in Haskell building on the previously derived abstractions in Category-Theory and Type-Theory. The abstractions and the EDSL implementation will then serve as a specification tool and at the same time code.
3. The pure functional nature together with the EDSL and abstractions in Category- \& Type-Theory allow for a new level of formal verification \& validation using a combination of mathematical proofs in Category- \& Type-Theory, algebraic reasoning in the EDSL and model-checking using Unit-Tests and QuickCheck. The expectation is that this allows us to formally specify hypotheses about expected outcomes about the dynamics (or emergent patterns) of our simulations which then can be verified.

Semantics for FrABS and our EDSL to reason about the results: are they reasonable? do they match the theory? if yes why? if not why not?
	- Can we define semantics for the EDSL to do reasoning about ABS in general?
	- How can we reason about ABS in general in pure functional programming?
		- dynamics
		- emergent properties
		- deadlocks
		- silence (no messages/agent-agent communication and interaction)
		- define semantics of FrABS based on semantics of FRP and Actors
		- what is emergence in ABS and how can we reason about it? 
			- identify emergent properties: equilibrium, behaviour on macroscale not defined on micro, chaos,...
			- can we anticipate emergent properties / dynamics just by looking at the code and reason about it?
			- can emergence in ABS be formalized?
				- hypothesis: it may be possible through functional programming because of its dual nature of declarative EDSL which awakens to a process during computation
					- what is the relation between emergence and computation? we need change over time (=computation) for emergence
					
		- Can we reason about the dynamics and equilibria of agent-based models of decentralized bilateral trading \& bartering?
