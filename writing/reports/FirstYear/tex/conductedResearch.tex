\section{Conducted Research}
TODO: Describe the research work carried out during this stage of the PhD and the outcomes. A literature review must be included. Then, as appropriate according to the PhD project, this section can also include theoretical and/or experimental methods, presentation and discussion of results, etc. In the case that papers have been submitted or published within the year of the review, this section can be shorter and focused on discussing the outcomes from those papers within the wider context of the PhD programme of study (papers to be included in the appendix).

Literature Review
- ask other students: Tuong, Olusola, Ivan for their 1st year reviews
- trichter: mit den 3 themen beginnen und dann runterbrechen und ins detail gehen, bis der gap gefunden wurde


the really unique thing which is ONLY possible in pure functional progranning is composition of concurrency
 

\subsection{Category Theory}
include paper on arrows my hughes

apply category theory to agent-based simulation: how can a ABS system itself be represented in category theory and can we represent models in this category theory as well?

ADOM: Agent Domain of Monads: https://www.haskell.org/communities/11-2006/html/report.html

 develop category theory behind FrABS: look into monads, arrows
