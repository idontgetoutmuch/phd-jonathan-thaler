\section{Conducted Research}
TODO: Describe the research work carried out during this stage of the PhD and the outcomes. A literature review must be included. Then, as appropriate according to the PhD project, this section can also include theoretical and/or experimental methods, presentation and discussion of results, etc. In the case that papers have been submitted or published within the year of the review, this section can be shorter and focused on discussing the outcomes from those papers within the wider context of the PhD programme of study (papers to be included in the appendix).
