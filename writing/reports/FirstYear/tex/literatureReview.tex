\chapter{Literature Review}
In this we present a literature-review which is driven by the motivating questions from the introduction. We present relevant sources which pose possible answers and directions of approaches to the posed questions. Based upon this information, in the next chapter we will select our directions and methods for our research, identify the gap we have to bridge with our PhD research and our objectives in achieving to close the gap.
