\section{Introduction}
TODO: Discuss the key aspects of the PhD project such as: background material, context, motivation, aims and objectives. Include a succinct and concise account of the progress and achievements during this stage of the PhD.

Direction of Research:
ABS mit FRP durch FrABS. SugarScape und Agent\_Zero implementieren
BEGRueNDEN wieso FP in ABS. Robustness, Testbarkeit mit Quickcheck, Verification, Validierung, Code = Spezifikation

\subsection{Problems of ABS in OO}
- Objects don't compose
- implicit state, change through effectful computations
- blurring of fundamental difference between agent and object: an agent is a metaphor, it is much more than an object. an object is: a uniquely identifieable compound of functions (=methods) and data

\subsection{Problems of ABS in general}
Specification: how is my model specified? 
Verification: does my implementation really match my specification? 
Validation: how to connect the results to the hypothesis? are the emergent properties the ones anticipated? if it is completely different why? note: we always MUST HAVE a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the simulation, otherwise we leave the path of scientific discovery. But we must admit that sometimes it is extremely hard to anticipate \textit{emergent patterns}. But anyway there must be \textit{some} hypothesis regarding the dynamics of the simulation.



\subsection{Functional approach to Agent-Based Modelling \& Simulation}
Because we left the path of OO and want to develop a completely different method we have fundamentally two problems to solve in our functional method:
1. Specifying the Agent-Based Model (ABM): Category-Theory, Type-Theory, EDSL
2. Implementing the ABM into an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS): FRP

\subsubsection{Challenges}
- how is an agent represented?
- how do agents pro-actively act?
- how do agents interact?
- how is the environment represented?
- how can agents act on the environment?
