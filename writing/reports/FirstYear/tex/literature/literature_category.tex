\section{Category-Theory}
Many concepts can be seen through category-theory. TODO: interdisciplinary rosetta stone 
Classic introductory text for computer scientists is \cite{pierce_basic_1991}, a more comprehensive introduction with more applications to the (computer) scientist is \cite{spivak_category_2014}.

\subsection{Emergence}
We already mentioned the work of Baas \cite{baas_emergence_1994}, \cite{baas_emergence_1997} on formalizing emergence through category-theory in the section on Verification \& Validation.

\subsection{Computation}
With the advent of monads the interest in category-theory surged and it was discovered that many computational concepts can be expressed through category-theory. Because many concepts of functional programming were put on firm grounds it would be only consequential to find a category-theoretical approach to functional ABS and put its foundations on firm category-theoretical grounds as well. 

\subsection{ABS}
So far only two papers looked into category-theoretical approaches to agent-based models and simulating \cite{beheshti_analyzing_2013}, \cite{lloyd_category-theoretic_2010} but none of them is really satisfying (TODO: why), making this an ideal research topic for the thesis.
