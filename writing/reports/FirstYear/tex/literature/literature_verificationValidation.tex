\section{Verification \& Validation of ABS}
Verification \& Validation are, generally speaking, independent processes to check whether a product meets its requirements and fulfills its intended purpose TODO: cite?. Here we focus explicitly on software verification \& validation where we identify \textit{Verification} to be the process of checking whether an implementation matches a given specification without any bugs or missing parts and \textit{Validation} to be the process of checking if the implementation meets high level requirements. TODO: cite?
To put short the difference between verification \& validation is that verification tries to answer "are we building the product right?" and validation "are we building the right product?" \cite{boehm_software_1989}. For (most of) the software built in the industry in well-defined software-development processes with its own quality control and quality assurance to answer these questions is rather straight-forward. Numerous techniques like checklists, software-tests, integration-tests,... have been developed to deal with Verification \& Validation. TODO: cite?

The question is how the above applies to ABS and from reviewing the literature, it becomes evident that in the context of ABS it is a much more difficult challenge and is still open research \footnote{Leigh Tesfatsion has, as part of her internet-presence on ACE, set up a whole site devoted just to this topic where she cites major references \url{http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/empvalid.htm}. Most of the literature we have investigated  is drawn from there.}. 

In this thesis we aim for replicating both the Sugarscape \cite{epstein_growing_1996} and Agent\_Zero \cite{epstein_agent_zero:_2014} models. In doing so we also perform verification \& validation on these models, or at least on parts of them. Also we aim to develop new methods of verification and validation of ABS based on theses models as use-cases. 

The issue of validation \& verification is also very closely related to the problem of replication. In the paper \cite{wilensky_making_2007} Wilensky discusses the issues with replicating a model and gives advices to modellers what details (e.g. order of events) to publish to support replication of models. They recommend to make pseudo-code publicly available and to converge to a common standard form for model publication in the long run. This is our approach: an EDSL can act both as a pseudo-code specification which is in fact already runnable code and due to its declarative and concise nature can act as a full description.

\subsection{Verification}
TODO: \cite{axelrod_advancing_1997}

In the work of \cite{axtell_aligning_1996} the authors tried to see whether the more complex Sugarscape model can be used to reproduce the results of \cite{axelrod_convergence_1995}. In both models agents have a tag for cultural identification which is comprised of a string of symbols. The question was whether Sugarscape, focusing on generating a complete artifical society which incorporates many more mechanisms like trading, war, ressources can reproduce the results of \cite{axelrod_convergence_1995} which only focuses on transmission of these cultural tags. Although interesting the question if two models are qualitatively equivalent is not what we want to pursue in our thesis as it requires a complete different direction of research.
The cooperative work of \cite{axtell_aligning_1996} gives insights into validation of computational models, in a process what they call "alignment". They try to determine if two models deal with the same phenomena. For this they tried to qualtiatively reproduce the same results of \cite{axelrod_convergence_1995} in the Sugarscape model of \cite{epstein_growing_1996}. Both models are of very different nature but try to investigate the qualitatively same phenomoenon: that of cultural processes. TODO: read

\subsection{Validation}
The question is what the \textit{meaning} of validation - are we building the right simulation? - in the context of ABS is. Wilensky defines model validation in \cite{wilensky_making_2007} to be the process of determining whether the simulation explains and corresponds to phenomenon of the real world.
