\section{Agent Formalisms}
When looking for ways to verification and validation of agent-based models and simulation, it is of interest to have a more formal representation of agents and ABS. This helps to clarify the key concepts in a unambiguous, formal way which can then be applied to formal methods e.g. algebraic reasoning for proofing properties of an agent system. Wooldridge \cite{wooldridge_introduction_2009}, \cite{wooldridge_intelligent_1995} gives an abstract architecture for intelligent agents, introducing the concept of actions of agents influencing the environment. The book of \cite{weiss_multiagent_2013} offers several chapters on the theoretical foundations and underpinning of multi-agent systems \footnote{Although all of these references are primarily rooted in the multi-agent system (MAS) field -which is quite distinct from ABS as stressed in the introduction - they can as well be applied to ABS and offer some inspiration from which to draw upon.}
