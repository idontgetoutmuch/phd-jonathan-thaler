\chapter{Future Work Plan}
\label{chap:future}

%TODO: A future work plan that is consistent with the progress to date, stating clearly the research question(s) to be addressed during the next year of the PhD.

In this chapter we break down the the four main objectives we have identified in Chapter \ref{chap:aimsObj} into small working packages, present mile-stones and holidays, relevant conferences, papers we want to publish (either conference or journal). A Gantt-Chart, reflecting all the details is found in Appendix \ref{app:gantt} in Figure TODO: ref
