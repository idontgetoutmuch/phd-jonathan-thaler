\section{Future Work Plan}
TODO: A future work plan that is consistent with the progress to date, stating clearly the research question(s) to be addressed during the next year of the PhD.

TODO: gantt chart!

\subsection{TODOs}
out of this i will build the gantt chart for the next 12 months+

\subsubsection{Category Theory}
develop category theory behind FrABS: look into monads, arrows

category theory foundations (monads, arrows)

\subsubsection{Implementation and Software-Engineering}
%how to implement in haskell (sugarscape, agent_zero) 
implement chapter 4 of sugarscape
implement chapter 5 of sugarscape
use monadic or arrowized programming for structuribg the siftware
implement schelling segregation in recursiveABS and report results

FrABS: SugarScape
1st prototype: pure-functional implemented, no category-theory/type-theory applied
2nd prototype: category-theory/type-theory applied: clean monadic / arrowized programming applied

Agent\_Zero
1st prototype: implemented the book, based upon FrABS 

\subsubsection{Verification and Validation}
look into QuickCheck to test and verificate FrABS. start with SIRS
(quickcheck, isabelle, agda?), recursive simulation

\subsubsection{Papers}
paper 2: recursive ABS
paper 3: FrABS - Towards pure functional programming in ABS
paper 4: Towards category theory in ABS
paper 5: verification and validation in ABS with pure functional programming


\subsubsection{Reading}
read "Writing For Computer Science"
read "Agent\_Zero"
read "category theory for the sciences"


\subsection{Concept of an Agent}
an agent is not an object but when implementing ABS in oo then it is tempting to treat an agent like that. when implementing it in a pure functional language like haskell, this temptation cannot arise which creates a different view on agents.
