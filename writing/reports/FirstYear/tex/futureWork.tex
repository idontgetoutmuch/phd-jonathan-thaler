\chapter{Future Work Plan}
TODO: A future work plan that is consistent with the progress to date, stating clearly the research question(s) to be addressed during the next year of the PhD.

TODO: gantt chart!

\subsection{TODOs}
out of this i will build the gantt chart for the next 12 months+

\subsubsection{Category Theory}
develop category theory behind FrABS: look into monads, arrows

category theory foundations (monads, arrows)

\subsubsection{Implementation and Software-Engineering}
%how to implement in haskell (sugarscape, agent_zero) 
implement chapter 4 of sugarscape
implement chapter 5 of sugarscape
use monadic or arrowized programming for structuribg the siftware
implement schelling segregation in recursiveABS and report results

FrABS: SugarScape
1st prototype: pure-functional implemented, no category-theory/type-theory applied
2nd prototype: category-theory/type-theory applied: clean monadic / arrowized programming applied

Agent\_Zero
1st prototype: implemented the book, based upon FrABS 

\subsubsection{Verification and Validation}
look into QuickCheck to test and verificate FrABS. start with SIRS
(quickcheck, isabelle, agda?), recursive simulation

\subsubsection{Papers}
paper 2: recursive ABS:  
paper 3: FrABS - Towards pure functional programming in ABS
paper 4: Towards category theory in ABS
paper 5: verification and validation in ABS with pure functional programming


\subsubsection{Reading}
read "Writing For Computer Science"
read "Agent\_Zero"
read "category theory for the sciences"


\subsection{Concept of an Agent}
an agent is not an object but when implementing ABS in oo then it is tempting to treat an agent like that. when implementing it in a pure functional language like haskell, this temptation cannot arise which creates a different view on agents.



- what do i want to have achieved in the first year?
	-> FrABS
	-> 1st conference paper published
	-> research questions
	-> milestones
	-> clear idea what i want to do and where to go
	
- Paradigm shift in ABS!

- Focus on Papers + Milestones
	-> find out which conferences I want to go and when the deadlines are

- organize as agile sprints

- Conferences
	-> Multi-Agent Systems, good for verification and validation: 			AAMS, Deadline in November
	-> Social Simulation, good for new methods in simulation e.g. MetaBS: 	SSC, Deadline in March
	-> functional, for presenting functional stuff but not too advanced:	TFP	
	-> TODO some functional, good for FrABS \& EDSL:						?

\subsection{Time-Line}
TODO: add Gantt-Chart
from june 2017 on detailed overview of activity
also project gantt-chart back to what i have done so far

The whole PhD lasts for 3 years, 36 Months, from October 2016 to September 2019 and thus I will structure it according to 3 years where each year will be a major milestone - which is also intended by the Computer School.

\subsection{ToDo}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Paper: agents' vs. agent's
	\item FRP \& ABS = FrABS: meeting with Henrik
	\item FrABS: work on it
	\item Agent\_Zero genauer anschauen: winter simulation papers, unterschied zu sugarscape?
	\item experiment with MetaABS in SchellingSegregation
	\item Refine project-plan 
\end{enumerate}







\subsection{1st Year: Groundwork}
In this year I will learn basics and develop and research the methodology I will use for the main work in the 2nd year. The year will be guided by the principal question of "How can Agent-Based Simulation be done using pure functional programming?".

\subsection{3rd Year: Finalizing, Publishing \& Writing}
The third year serves to refine, finish and publish the research of the 2nd year (ideally a journal paper) and then to write the final thesis. To have a bit of distraction and to prevent myself to become too locked in in writing on the thesis I will also work on my optional philosophical paper and hope to at least finish them and maybe publish them - at least I want to present them to 2-3 audiences (e.g. FP Lunch) to test the reaction.
