\chapter{Challenges}

The challenges one faces when implementing an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) plain, without support from a library (e.g. Repast) are manifold. In the paper on update-strategies (TODO: cite) we've discussed already in a very general, programming language agnostic way, the fundamental things to consider. Here we will look at the problem in a much more technical way by precisely defining what problems need to be solved and what approaches are from a programming paradigm view-point - where we focus on the pure functional (FP) and imperative object-oriented (OO) paradigms.

Generally one faces the following challenges:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Agent Representation - How is an Agent represented in the paradigm?
	\item Agent Updating - How is the set of Agents organized and how are all of them updated?
	\item Agent-Agent Interactions 
	\item Environment Representation
	\item Environment Updating
	\item Agent-Environment Interactions
	\item Replications
\end{enumerate}

It is important to note that we are facing a non-trivial software-engineering problem which implies that there are no binary correct \ wrong approaches - whatever works good enough is OK. This implies that the challenges as discussed below, can be also approached in different ways but we tried to stick as close as possible to the \textit{best practices} of the respective paradigm.
