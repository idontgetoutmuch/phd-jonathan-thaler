\section{Motivation}
The observations of the problems presented in the previous section leads us to posing fundamental directions and questions which are the basis of the motivation of our thesis.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Alternative approach to object-oriented ABMS} - Is there an alternative view to the established object-oriented view to ABMS which does treat agents \textit{not} like objects and does not mix the concept of agent and object? Is there an alternative to the established object-oriented implementation approach to ABMS which offers composability, explicit data-flow?
	\item \textbf{Verification \& Validation of ABMS} - Is there a way for formal specification and verification which is still readable and does not fall back to pure mathematics? What exactly is the meaning of validation in ABMS and is there a way to do formal validation in ABMS? 
\end{enumerate}
