does my research apply to a larger scale? 

\section{Simulations}
TODO: My approach to dependent types in ABS might be applicable to simulations in general: equilibrium \& totality, hypotheses formulation. 

\section{Multi Agent Systems}
TODO: this is very obvious.
dependent types should be very useful there because MAS is very interested on correctness, verification and formally reasoning about a system / their agents.
also distributed MAS systems can make use of dependent typed message passing (but this is really a different topic)

\section{Distributed search}
TODO: Julie Greensmith mentioned distributed search algorithms as an example where localized entities (speak: agents) are interacting with each other.
