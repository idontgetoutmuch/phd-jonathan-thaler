\chapter{Generalising Research}
\label{chap:generalising}

does my research apply to a larger scale? 

\section{Simulations}
TODO: My approach to dependent types in ABS might be applicable to simulations in general: equilibrium \& totality, hypotheses formulation. 

\section{Multi Agent Systems}
TODO: this is very obvious

\section{Distributed search}
TODO: Julie Greensmith mentioned distributed search algorithms as an example where localized entities (speak: agents) are interacting with each other.
