\chapter{Future Work Plan}
\label{chap:future}

We will be researching the \textit{why} of our approach, which we claim is an easier and stronger approach to verification and validation (V \& V). We need to clarify the meaning of V \& V in both areas we trying to gap, pure functional programming and agent-based simulation, and how they related to each other and how we can connect them. Further we need to quantify our claims of less sources of bugs through other research and comparing it to imperative OO approaches.

In this time we will investigate the use of dependent types in our pure functional approach to agent-based simulation which we hypothesise should allow an unprecedented level of verification and validation, not possible (even not on a theoretical level) with imperative, traditional object-oriented approaches. There exists literally no research on this topic thus it will form the unique and sufficiently advanced, novel contribution of our PhD to the field. We will also write an additional paper which will investigate how dependent types can be made of use in ABS.
Around December 2018 I will start writing another paper which is targeted for an agent-based simulation journal and is written as a conceptual paper, describing the approach and benefits of purely and dependently typed agent-based simulation. While writing this paper I will start constructing the main argument structure of my thesis so I have structure already when I start writing the thesis in April 2019. The last 6 months of the PhD (April 2019 - September 2019) will be dedicated to writing up the thesis and conducting additional research if still necessary.

%	writing 4th paper: towards pure functional ABS. targeted for an agent-based simulation audience and written as a journal paper. this wont need any unique research but is basically a conceptual paper explaining my insights and research so far on a not too technical level to the ABS community - thus it is more about writing and not about unique research and programming, this has been done already at this point. this paper will help me very much in defining a basic structure of the thesis

%Papers route: end of march 2018: PFE paper, dependent types in ABS: march 2019 for ICFP 2019, towards pure functional abs paper as concept paper to the ABS Community until april 2019 (before starting thesis writing) 

In this chapter we discuss in more detail how we plan to approach the aim and objectives stated in Chapter \ref{chap:aimsObj}. Further we give a short overview of planned papers and present a Gantt-Chart \ref{fig:gantt} reflecting the most important activities and relevant milestones.

\section{Approaching the Objectives: Dependent Types}
We have already begun working on dependent types and the plan is to do an in-depth research and examination of the ideas outlined in the chapter \ref{sec:dep_absconcepts} on the concepts of dependent types in Agent-Based Simulation.

\section{Planned Papers}
For the remainder of the Ph.D. we planned for two more papers.
The first one will be about applying dependent types to agent-based simulation and targeted towards a functional programming journal. We plan on start writing it end of the year around November / December 2018.

The second paper will be conceptual \textit{towards} paper which is basically a condensed version of all my research on pure functional programming and dependent types in Agent-Based Simulation and is targeted towards an agent-based simulation journal. With that paper we want to try to sell the concepts found in our research to the ABS community. We plan on start writing it around February 2019 as a precursor to start writing the thesis.

\section{Writing the Thesis}
I plan on start writing the thesis in April 2019 and hope to finish it at the end of the Ph.D. programme in September 2019.
