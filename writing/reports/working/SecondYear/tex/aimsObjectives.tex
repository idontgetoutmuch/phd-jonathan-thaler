\chapter{Aims and Objectives}
\label{chap:aimsObj}

This chapter gives a compact and concise overview of the aims and objectives. Chapter \ref{chap:future} gives a more in-depth plan and details in how we will approach the aim in general and the objectives in particular.

\section{Aim}
The aim of this Ph.D. is to investigate how the pure functional programming paradigm without dependent types, as in Haskell, and with dependent types, as in Idris, can be used to implement Agent-Based Simulation and what the benefits are in doing so.

\subsection{Hypotheses}
\paragraph{Hypothesis 1: Using pure functional programming without dependent types to implement Agent-Based Simulations leads to simulation software which has less sources of bugs and is easier to verify.} %TODO: again we are having a problematic measure: how do we measure 'more likely', 'less sources' and 'easier'?}

\paragraph{Hypothesis 2: Using pure functional programming with dependent types to implement Agent-Based Simulations allows a substantially more constructive approach, which reduces the impedance mismatch between the test-driven approach of established object-oriented approaches and the constructive and generative nature of Agent-Based Simulation itself. This should narrow the gap between model-specification and its implementation substantially, which by definition, leads to a simulation which is more likely to be correct.}

\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
	% NOTE: we have done that in our 2nd paper: Pure Functional Epidemics
	%\item Develop a library for general-purpose Agent-Based Simulation in Haskell to have a tool in the \textit{pure} functional programming paradigm (without dependent types) to be used for conducting the research. This will allow us to develop the fundamental concepts of pure functional programming in Agent-Based Simulation in general.

	\item Implement a pure functional Agent-Based Simulation in Haskell. This will allow us to develop the fundamental concepts of pure functional programming in Agent-Based Simulation in general.

	% NOTE: we have done that in our 2nd paper: Pure Functional Epidemics
	\item Explore the benefits and drawbacks of using \textit{pure} functional programming (without dependent types) in Agent-Based Simulations.

	\item Implement a dependently typed agent-based simulation of the SIR and SugarScape model. This will allow us to develop the fundamental concepts of dependent types in Agent-Based Simulation in general.

	% NOTE: we have done that in our 2nd paper: Pure Functional Epidemics
	%\item Explore the benefits and drawbacks of using \textit{pure and dependently typed} functional programming in Agent-Based Simulations.

	% TODO: how can we quantify that?
	%\item Explore how pure functional programming with dependent types can increase the correctness of Agent-Based Simulations.

	\item Explore how far we can narrow the gap between model-specification and implementation using dependent types in Agent-Based Simulation. %, exploring the correspondence between the constructive nature of ABS and dependent types.
