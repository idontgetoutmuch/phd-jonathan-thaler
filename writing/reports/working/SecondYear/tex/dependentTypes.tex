\chapter{Dependent Types}
\label{chap:dependent_types}
Dependent types are a very powerful addition to functional programming as they allow us to express even stronger guarantees about the correctness of programs \textit{already at compile-time}. They go as far as allowing to formulate programs and types as constructive proofs which must be \textit{total} by definition \cite{thompson_type_1991, mckinna_why_2006, altenkirch_pi_2010}. 

So far no research using dependent types in agent-based simulation exists at all. We have already started to explore this for the first time and ask more specifically how we can add dependent types to our functional approach, which conceptual implications this has for ABS and what we gain from doing so. We are using Idris \cite{brady_idris_2013} as the language of choice as it is very close to Haskell with focus on real-world application and running programs as opposed to other languages with dependent types e.g. Agda and Coq which serve primarily as proof assistants.

We hypothesise, that  dependent types will allow us to push the correctness of agent-based simulations to a new, unprecedented level by narrowing the gap between model specification and implementation. The investigation of dependent types in ABS will be the main unique contribution to knowledge of my Ph.D.

In the following section \ref{sec:dep_background}, we give an introduction of the concepts behind dependent types and what they can do. Further we give a very brief overview of the foundational and philosophical concepts behind dependent types. In Section \ref{sec:dep_absconcepts} we briefly discuss ideas of how the concepts of dependent types could be applied to agent-based simulation and in Section \ref{sec:dep_vav_deptypes} we very shortly discuss the connection between Verification \& Validation and dependent types.

\section{Verification, Validation and Dependent Types}
\label{sec:dep_vav_deptypes}
Dependent types allow to encode specifications on an unprecedented level, narrowing the gap between specification and implementation - ideally the code becomes the specification, making it correct-by-construction. The question is ultimately how far we can formulate model specifications in types - how far we can close the gap in the domain of ABS. Unless we cannot close that gap completely, to arrive at a sufficiently confidence in correctness, we still need to test all properties at run-time which we cannot encode at compile-time in types.

Nonetheless, dependent types should allow to substantially reduce the amount of testing which is of immense benefit when testing is costly. Especially in simulations, testing and validating a simulation can often take many hours - thus guaranteeing properties and correctness already at compile time can reduce that bottleneck substantially by reducing the number of test-runs to make.

Ultimately this leads to a very different development process than in the established object-oriented approaches, which follow a test-driven process. There one defines the necessary interface of an object with empty implementations for a given use-case first, then writes tests which cover all possible cases for the given use-case. Obviously all tests should fail because the functionality behind it was not implemented yet. Then one starts to implement the functionality behind it  step-by-step until no test-case fails. This means that one runs all tests repeatedly to both check if the test-case one is working on is not failing anymore and to make sure that old test-cases are not broken by new code. The resulting software is then trusted to be correct because no counter examples through test hypotheses, could be found. The problem is: we could forget / not think of cases, which is the easier the more complex the software becomes (and simulations are quite complex beasts). Thus in the end this is a deductive approach.

With pure functional programming and dependent types the process is now mostly constructive, type-driven (see \cite{brady_type-driven_2017}). In that approach one defines types first and is then guided by these types and the compiler in an interactive fashion towards a correct implementation, ensured at compile-time. As already noted, the ABS methodology is constructive in nature but the established object-oriented test-driven implementation approach not as much, creating an impedance mismatch. We expect that a type-driven approach using dependent types reduces that mismatch by a substantial amount.

Note that \textit{validation} is a different matter here: independent of our implementation approach we still need to validate the simulation against the real-world / ground-truth. This obviously requires to run the full simulation which could take up hours in either programming paradigm, making them absolutely equal in this respect. Also the comparison of the output to the real-world / ground-truth is completely independent to the paradigm. The fundamental difference happens in case of changes made to the code during validation: in case of the established test-driven object-oriented approach for every minor change one (should) re-run all tests, which could take up a substantial amount of additional time. Using a constructive, type-driven approach this is dramatically reduced and can often be completely omitted because the correctness of the change can be either guaranteed in the type or by informally reasoning about the code.
