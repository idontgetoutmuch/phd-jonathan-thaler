\chapter{Dependent Types}
\label{chap:dependent_types}
Dependent types are a very powerful addition to functional programming as they allow us to express even stronger guarantees about the correctness of programs \textit{already at compile-time}. They go as far as allowing to formulate programs and types as constructive proofs which must be \textit{total} by definition \cite{thompson_type_1991, mckinna_why_2006, altenkirch_pi_2010}. 

We hypothesise, that  dependent types will allow us to push the correctness of agent-based simulations to a new, unprecedented level. The investigation of dependent types in ABS will be the main unique contribution to knowledge of my Ph.D.

So far no research using dependent types in agent-based simulation exists at all. We have already started to explore this for the first time and ask more specifically how we can add dependent types to our functional approach, which conceptual implications this has for ABS and what we gain from doing so. We plan on using Idris \cite{brady_idris_2013} as the language of choice as it is very close to Haskell with focus on real-world application and running programs as opposed to other languages with dependent types e.g. Agda and Coq which serve primarily as proof assistants.

In the following section \ref{sec:dep_background}, we give an introduction of the concepts behind dependent types and what they can do. Further we give a very brief overview of the foundational and philosophical concepts behind dependent types. In Section \ref{sec:dep_absconcepts} we briefly discuss ideas of how the concepts of dependent types could be applied to agent-based simulation.
