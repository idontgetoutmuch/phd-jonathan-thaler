\chapter{Work To Date}
\label{chap:work_to_date}

%From a very general perspective I am researching a novel implementation approach to ABS. The hypothesis is that due to its underlying foundations of pure functional programming, this approach leads to simulation software which is easier to verify and validate and thus more likely to be correct, less sources of bugs and is conceptually cleaner.

In the first half of my PhD (October 2016 - March 2018) I have learned the underlying foundations of pure functional programming, did lots of prototyping and ultimately developed a way of implementing ABS in this approach. This resulted in a paper (see Appendix \ref{app:pfe}) which discusses \textit{how} to do agent-based simulation with pure functional programming as foundation and how to solve the fundamental problems of encapsulating agent-state, doing agent-interactions and bringing in environments in this setting.

Here we give a concise overview over the activities performed in the 2nd year.

\paragraph{Social Simulation Conference 2017}
I participated
The paper \cite{thaler_art_2017} which we wrote in the first year got selected to be published in the Conference Proceedings of the Social Simulation Conference 2017.

\paragraph{Papers Submitted: Pure Functional Epidemics}
The paper as attached in Appendix \ref{app:pfe}.

\paragraph{Haskell Communities and Activities Report (HCAR) May 2018}
We wrote a new entry for the HCAR May 2018, which tries to compile and publish novel and on-going ideas in the Haskell community. It is freely available under \url{https://www.haskell.org/communities/05-2018/html/report.html}. We hope that our idea and the work of our PhD gets a bit more attention and may start some discussions with people interested in this work.

\paragraph{2nd Year Report}
This document.

\paragraph{Talks}
So far three talks were given. The first one was the talk about my first paper at the Social Simulation Conference 2016 in Dublin. The second one was a presentation of the ideas to Master Students of my 1st Supervisor. The third was presenting my ideas about dependent types in Agent-Based Simulation at the FP Away Day end of June.
