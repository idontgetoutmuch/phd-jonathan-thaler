2018
January - February
	prototyping event-scheduling concepts in pure functional ABS

Here we give a concise overview over the activities performed in the 2nd year.

\section{Social Simulation Conference 2017}


\section{Paper Published}
TODO: Art of Iteration was published in SSC2017 proceedings

\section{Papers Submitted}
\subsection{Pure Functional Epidemics}
This paper, which is attached in Appendix \ref{app:pfe}

\section{Reports}
\subsection{Haskell Communities and Activities Report (HCAR) May 2017}
We wrote a new entry for the HCAR May 2017, which tries to compile and publish novel and on-going ideas in the Haskell community. It is freely available under \url{https://www.haskell.org/communities/05-2017/html/report.html}. We hope that our idea and the work of our PhD gets a bit more attention and may start some discussions with people interested in this work.

\subsection{2nd Year Report}
This document.


\section{Talks}
So far only two talks were given. The first one was a presentation of the ideas underlying the update-strategies paper at the IMA - seminar day. The second was presenting my ideas about functional reactive ABS to the FP-Lab Group at the FPLunch.
