\subsection{Haskell Communities and Activities Report (HCAR) May 2017}
We wrote a new entry for the HCAR May 2017, which tries to compile and publish novel and on-going ideas in the Haskell community. It is freely available under \url{https://www.haskell.org/communities/05-2017/html/report.html}. We hope that our idea and the work of our PhD gets a bit more attention and may start some discussions with people interested in this work.
