\section*{Abstract}
TODO: we need to distinguish between various meanings of 'correct'
1. correctness of software: the implementation is correct up to a model specification
2. correctness of a simulation: the implementation is correct up to a model specification AND it generates the same dynamics

This Ph.D. investigates how Agent-Based Simulations (ABS) can be implemented using the functional programming paradigm and what the benefits and drawbacks are when doing so. Due to the nature of the functional paradigm we hypothesize that by using this approach we can increase the correctness and gain insights into dynamics of the simulation to on an unprecedented level not possible with the established object-oriented approaches in the field. The correctness of a simulation and its results is of paramount interest in scientific computing thus making our research high impact.

So far we researched \textit{how} to do ABS using the functional paradigm, where we implemented a highly promising approach by building on Functional Reactive Programming using the library Yampa and generalising it to Monadic Stream Functions. By this we could show that ABS is indeed very possible in functional programming as it allowed us to implement a number of different agent-based models, incorporating discrete time-semantics similar to Discrete Event Simulation and continuous time-flows like System Dynamics.

During the research conducted so far, it became apparent that this approach exhibits a few unique properties which indeed supports our initial hypothesis. We have started to systematically explore these properties and will commit our research of the remaining year to develop this fully.
