\section{Testing}
TODO: explore ABS testing in pure functional Haskell


\subsection{Black Box Verification}
Defined as treating the functionality to test as a black box with inputs and outputs and comparing controlled inputs to expected outputs.

- testing of distributions e.g. all agents recover on average after illness duration
- testing of the final dynamics: how close do they match the analytical solution
- can we express model properties in tests e.g. quickcheck?
- isolated tests: how easy can we test parts of an agent / simulation?

\subsection{White Box Verification}
Defined as directly looking at the code and reasoning that the code does really what it has to implement.

- coverage testing
