\section{Testing}
TODO: explore ABS testing in pure functional Haskell
- testing of distributions e.g. all agents recover on average after illness duration
- testing of the final dynamics: how close do they match the analytical solution
- can we express model properties in tests e.g. quickcheck?
- isolated tests: how easy can we test parts of an agent / simulation?
