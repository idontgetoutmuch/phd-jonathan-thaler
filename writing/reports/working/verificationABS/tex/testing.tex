\section{Testing / Verification}
TODO: explore ABS testing in pure functional Haskell
- we need to distinguish between two types of testing/verification
	-> 1. testing/verification of models for which we have real-world data or an analytical solution which can act as a ground-truth. examples for such models are the SIR model, stock-market simulations, social simulations of all kind
	-> 2. testing/verification of models which are just exploratory and which are only be inspired by real-world phenomena. examples for such models are Epsteins Sugarscape and Agent\_Zero
	
\subsection{Black Box Verification}
Defined as treating the functionality to test as a black box with inputs and outputs and comparing controlled inputs to expected outputs.

In Black Box Verification one generally feeds input and compares it to expected output. In the case of ABS we have two things to black-box test:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Agent Behaviour - test isolated agent behaviour under given inputs using unit- and property-based testing
	\item Simulation Dynamics - compare emergent dynamics of the ABS as a whole under given inputs to an analytical solution / real-world dynamics in case there exists some using statistical tests
	\item Hypotheses- test whether hypotheses are valid / invalid using unit- and property-based testing. TODO: how can we formulate hypotheses in unit- and/or property-based tests?
\end{enumerate}

- testing of the final dynamics: how close do they match the analytical solution
- can we express model properties in tests e.g. quickcheck?
- property-testing shines here
- isolated tests: how easy can we test parts of an agent / simulation?

\subsubsection{Comparison of dynamics against existing data}
- utilise a statistical test with H0 "ABS and comparison is not the same" and H1 "ABS and comparison is the same"
- how many replications and how do we average?
- which statistical test do we implement? (steward robinson simulation book, chapter 12.4.4)
	-> Normalizsed Mean Squared Error (NMSE)
	-> TODO: implement confidence interval 
	-> TODO: what about chi-squared?
	-> TODO: what about paired-t confidence interval

IMPORTANT: this is not what we are after here in this paper, statistical tests are a science on their own and there actually exists quite a large amount of literature for conducting statistical tests on ABS dynamics: Robinson Book (TODO: find additional literature)	

\subsection{White Box Verification}
Defined as directly looking at the code and reasoning that the code does really what it has to implement.
- coverage testing
