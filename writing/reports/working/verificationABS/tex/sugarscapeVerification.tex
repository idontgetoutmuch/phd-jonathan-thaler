\section{Verification of Sugarscape}
Sugarscape is an exploratory model inspired by real-world phenomenon which means it has lots of hypotheses implicit in the model but there does not exist real-world data / dynamics against which one could validate the simulated dynamics. Still we can conduct black-box verification because we have an informal model specification but we cannot do any statistical testing of simulated dynamics as we don't have data acting as ground-truth. But what we can do and what we will explore extensively in this section is how we can encode hypotheses about the dynamics (prior to running the simulation) in unit- and property-based tests and check them. Obviously white-box verification applies as well because we can reason about the code whether it matches the informal model specification or not.
