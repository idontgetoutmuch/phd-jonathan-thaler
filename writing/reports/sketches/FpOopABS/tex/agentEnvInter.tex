\chapter{Agent-Environment Interactions}

\section{OO}
Agents simply call methods on the Environment to which they hold a reference thus changing the environment. The problem is much more subtle if we want true parallel or concurrent / actor strategies. In the case of parallel strategy the other agents must not see the changes to the environment. In the case of the concurrent / actor strategies the access to the environment must be synchronized.
