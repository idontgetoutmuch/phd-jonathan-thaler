\section{Agents as Signals}
Due to the underlying nature and motivation of FRP and Yampa, agents can be seen as signals which are generated and consumed by a signal-function which is the behaviour of an agent.  If an agent does not change, the output-signal should be constant and if the agent changes e.g. by sending a message, changing its state,... the output-signal should change as well. A dead agent then should have no signal at all.
The question is if the agents of our agent-based SIR implementation are true signals: do the dynamics stay constant when we sample the system with $\Delta t = 0$? We hypothesize that our agents are true signals, thus they should not change when time does not change because they are completely time-dependent and rely completely on time-semantics. When actually running the simulation with $\Delta t = 0$ one gets the results as seen in Figure \ref{fig:sir_abs_zero_dt}.

As can be seen  the dynamics are becoming constant \textit{but} with a minor delay: infected increases a bit while susceptible decreases as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:sir_abs_zero_dt_zoom}. This is due to the delay of message delivery which takes one $\Delta t$, independent of its value - messages are also delivered when $\Delta t = 0$. Only message-generating functions, which depend on non-zero $\Delta t$ to generate messages, will then stop generating messages. Reactive functions which act on incoming messages can still create change as they do not rely on time-semantics but just on the discrete event of a message arrival - which is the case in the transition from susceptible to infected.

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth, angle=0]{./shared/fig/dtzero/SIR_ABS_zeroDt_mid_zoom.png}
	\caption{Zoom-in to step 51, marked with the black line from where on $\Delta t = 0$ for the next 50 steps. The recovered ratio stays constant but a few agents get infected even \textit{after} having switched to $\Delta t = 0$ which happens due to the message delivery lag. After all messages have been delivered, the signal stays constant until non-zero $\Delta t$ are turned on again.}

\end{figure}

Note that agents of models with no time-semantics won't exhibit this behaviour - the dynamics will change even in case of $\Delta t = 0$ as agents act on every update and don't care about $\Delta t$ and just assume that every update occurs after $\Delta t$ independent of the actual value of it. We implemented the function \textit{doRepeatedlyEvery} which allows to transform a time-agnostic agent-behaviour into one. It is built on Yampas \textit{repeatedly} function and has the following signature:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{haskell}
doRepeatedlyEvery :: Time -> AgentBehaviour -> AgentBehaviour
\end{minted}

This function takes a time interval and an agent behaviour signal-function and returns a new agent behaviour signal-function which runs the argument signal-function every time-interval. Note that this function is subject to sampling issues. When the time-interval is very small one needs to run the simulation with a $\Delta t \leq Time$ otherwise the dynamics would show delayed activation of the agent behaviour.
