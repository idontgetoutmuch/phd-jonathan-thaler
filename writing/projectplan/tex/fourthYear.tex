\subsection{4th Year: Pending Period}
It is very hard to finish ALL within the 3rd year and it is very likely that I will enter the 4th year - pending period. I plan on spending in this period not more than till Christmas as I have no funding in this time and I want to finish within time.

Important mile-stones:

\begin{center}
