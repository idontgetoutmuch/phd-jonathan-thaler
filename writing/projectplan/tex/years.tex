\section{Years}
The whole PhD lasts for 3 years, 36 Months, from October 2016 to September 2019 and thus I will structure it according to 3 years where each year will be a major milestone - which is also intended by the Computer School.

[ ] todo: implement functional reactive abs (FrABS)
[ ] todo: define an EDSL for FrABS which is at the same time model specification- and implementation-language
[ ] todo: define semantics of FrABS based on semantics of FRP and Actors
[ ] until 1st year report (july): basic implementation of FrABS, literature research about emergence, basic study of MetaABS, reasoning about H&C cross patterns, writing 1st year report
