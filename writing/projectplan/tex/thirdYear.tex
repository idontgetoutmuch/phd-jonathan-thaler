\subsection{3rd Year: Finalizing, Publishing \& Writing}
The third year serves to refine, finish and publish the research of the 2nd year (ideally a journal paper) and then to write the final thesis. To have a bit of distraction and to prevent myself to become too locked in in writing on the thesis I will also work on my optional philosophical paper and hope to at least finish them and maybe publish them - at least I want to present them to 2-3 audiences (e.g. FP Lunch) to test the reaction.
