\subsection{3rd Year: Finalizing, Publishing \& Writing}
I plan to be finished - or nearly finished - at the end of the 3rd year. In this year I will finalize the work of the 2nd year, publish the my main journal paper (and optional fun-papers if possible) and will write down the thesis. \\ To have a bit of distraction and to prevent myself to become too locked in in writing on the thesis I will also work on my optional fun-papers (see below) and hope to at least finish them and maybe publish them - at least I want to present them to 2-3 audiences (e.g. FP Lunch) to test the reaction (especially the Genesis-Paper).

\begin{itemize}
\item Finalize research of 2nd year
\item Publish journal paper
\item Write thesis
\item Work on fun-papers
\end{itemize}
