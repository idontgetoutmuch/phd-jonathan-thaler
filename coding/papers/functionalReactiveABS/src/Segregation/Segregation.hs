-- TODO implement segregation
-- TODO implement recursive simulations: MetaABS: test it using the segregation model. run recursive simulation for local neighbourhood only
    -- for each move compute 1 step recursive and see how this move performs. if it improves the outcome, then take it otherwise stay.
