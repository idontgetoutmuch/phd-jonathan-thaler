TODO: Consider a provocative abstract and an interesting title

Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABM/S) is still a young discipline and the dominant approach to it is using object-oriented methods. This thesis goes into the opposite direction and asks how ABM/S can be mapped to and implemented using functional methods and what one gains from doing so. To the best knowledge of the author, so far no proper treatment of ABM/S in this field exists but a few papers which only scratch the surface. The author argues that approaching ABM/S using functional methods offers a wealth of new powerful tools and methods. The most obvious one is that when using pure functional computation reasoning about the correctness and about total and partial correctness of the simulation becomes possible. Also pure functional approaches allow the design of an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) in which then the models can be formulated by domain-experts. The strongest point in using EDSL is that ideally the distinction between specification and implementation disappears: the model specification is then already the code of the simulation-program. This allows to rule out a serious class of errors where specification and implementation does not match, which is especially a big problem in scientific computing thus making functional methods in ABM/S especially suitable for scientific computing. The application will be in the field of agent-based computational economics (ACE) where the primary goal will be to compare functional and non-functional methods for developing ACE simulations and to identify in which scenarios pure functional methods shine and where their limits are.

\section{Introduction}
WHY FUNCTIONAL? "because its the ultimate approach to scientific computing": fewer bugs due to mutable state (why? is thos shown obkectively by someone?), shorter (again as above, productivity), more expressive and closer to math, EDSL, EDSL=model=simulation, better parallelising due to referental transparency, reasoning

scientific results need to be reproduced, especially when they have high impact. a more formal approach of specifying the model and the simulation (model=simulation) could lead to easier sharing and easier reporduction without ambigouites

pure functional agent-model \& theory, EDSL framework in Haskell for ACE

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which kind of problem do we have?
\item What aim is there? Solving the problem? 
\item How the aim is achieved by enumerating VERY CLEAR objectives.
\item What the impact one expects (hypothesis) and what it is (after results).
\end{enumerate}

Note: It is not in the interest of the researcher to develop new economic theories but to research the use of functional methods (programming and specification) in agent-based computational economics (ACE).

NOTE: Get the readerâ€™s attention early in the introduction: motivation, significance, originality and novelty.

\subsection{Methods}
Methods need to be selected to implement the simulations. Special emphasis will be put on functional ones which will then be compared to established methods in the field of ABM/S and ACE. 

\subsection{Scenarios}
To apply and test functional methods in ACE, four scenarios of ACE are selected and then the methods applied and compared with each other to see how each of them perform in comparison. The 4 selected scenarios represent a selection of the challenges posed in ACE: from very abstract ones to very operational ones.

\subsection{Comparison}
Each of the selected scenarios is then implemented using the selected methods where each solution is then compared against the following criteria: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item suitability for scientific computation
\item robustness
\item error-sources
\item testability
\item stability
\item extendability
\item size of code
\item maintainability
\item time taken for development
\item verification \& correctness
\item replications \& parallelism
\item EDSL
\end{enumerate}

This will then allow to compare the different methods against each other and to show under which circumstances functional methods shine and when they should not be used.

\section{Literature Research: Agent-based Economics (ACE)}

\subsection{Foundations}
TODO: the reading should pull out the essence of what types of ACE there are and what features each type has (continuous/discrete time, complex agent communication, equilibriua, networks amongst agents,...)

NOTE: I REALLY need to work out what is special in ACE? what is the unique property of ACE AS compared to other ABM/S? Conjecture: equilibrium of dynamics is the central aspect.

\section{Literature Research: Methods in ACE \& ABM}
TODO: the reading should look which of the given methods and how they are used in ACE/ABM. Here a pre-selection of methods was done because the thesis is interested in researching the - novel - functional approach and thus has its special focus on this approach and needs other classical/state-of-the-art approaches for comparison.

\section{Scenarios}
\subsection{Scenario 1: Public goods games}
This scenario should be very well suited for functional methods

\subsection{Scenario 2: Decentralized bartering \& trading}
Something in between 1 and 4 but closer to 1

\subsection{Scenario 3: Auctions}
Something in between 1 and 4 but closer to 4

\subsection{Scenario 4: Artificial economies}
This scenario should be NOT well suited for functional methods

Many parallel, concurrently interacting objects with non-continuous, complex behaviour.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Method 1: Haskell}
This is the main functional method this thesis wants to investigate as it is the purest functional programming language of all the methods.

\subsection{Method 2: Scala \& Actors (Akka)}
This method was selected because Scala is an object-oriented functional programming language and has a powerful library included which implements the actor-model. Because actors and agents are closely related this is an obvious method to follow.

\subsection{Method 3: AnyLogic / NetLogo / Repast}
These tools are state-of-the-art in ABM/S and ACE and are included to show how one can perform scenarios (see below) with these tools.

\subsection{Method 4: Java}
Java is the state-of-the-art programming language in ABM/S and ACE and is thus included as well as a benchmark against such a state-of-the-art.
