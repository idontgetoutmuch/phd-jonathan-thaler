\begin{abstract}
ll sciences have their genesis-model (how did the world come into existence, what is the reason for existence?) but computer science has not, so I want to set out to develop such from a computer science perspective - actually I want to disguise deep spiritual truths in scientific cloak, that would be really fun. \\
Thus the idea is to write a paper with the title "Reality as an agent-based simulation of free will" in which I motivate that the world and humankind is a simulation to see free will in action in a sandboxed environment (as opposed to spirit, which is an outer level of simulation). Thus I need to develop then a model of free will from a computer science perspective and give an answer WHO implemented the simulation.

free will on a machine is a contradiction. the machine works according to very strict rules. free will can be completely unpredictable. or is free will just an imagination? if one confronts a decision maker within short time with too much information then the outcome it is unpredictable
