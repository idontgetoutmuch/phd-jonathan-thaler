write retrospective of the evolution of my computerscience interests

i was no genius, i was also not extremely smart, i sometimes took long to understand, i was just good enough but what sets me appart is: if i understood it was fundamental and i could transfer it to other areas as well, if i really wanted to do something i pursued it so long until i could do it (gameengine), there was always a bit of playfulness  in my approaches: it was the mere curiosity how things would ubfold, the fun in exploring unknown territory - and when i had the feeling i understood enough i moved on to new territories. thus a major shift of interests from starting with age of 15 until now with age of 33: from basic text games to gui programming to 3d graphics to web 2.0 development to enterprise backend applications to operating systems to  embedded systems to system simulation and now to the very basics and mysteries of computation itselfs (todo comment on every topic why and in what i was interested)
