\subsection*{Aim of my PhD}
After reflecting on the whole thing a bit the following milestones are of interest:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implementing the functional framework of the paper \cite{Botta20114025} in Haskell \& Agda
\item Apply it to the model of Gintis as presented in \cite{Gintis2006} and specified in the paper "Mathematical specifications for agent-based
models of exchange: a case study" by N. Botta, A. Mandel, M. Hofmann, S. Schupp. Possibly the implementation and this application should go hand in hand to test the implementation and to preventing myself of heading into "nowhere".
\item Extend the framework to model time explicitly to allow the simulation of continuous time.
\item Implement Continuous Batch Auctions as proposed by Budish et al. in the paper "The High-Frequency Trading Arms Race: Frequent Batch Auctions as a Market Design Response".
\item Maybe present my own empirical model of agents
\item Use framework to test hypotheses and verify them
\end{enumerate}

In the first year the following should be done:

\begin{itemize}
\item Understand Equilibrium Models
\item Understand Market Micro-structure
\item Do literature research on dynamics of equilibrium 
\item Learn dependent-type programming in Agda
\item Learn monadic programming in Haskell
\item Fully understand the framework in \cite{Botta20114025}
\item Design software of the framework: lay out modules, define interfaces, define functions,
\item Implement the framework
\item Publish first paper about the implementation of the framework
\end{itemize}
