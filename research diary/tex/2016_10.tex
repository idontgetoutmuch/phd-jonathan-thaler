\subsection*{Aim of my PhD}
After reflecting on the whole thing a bit the following roadmap seems to be the way to go

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implementing the functional framework of the paper \cite{Botta20114025} in Haskell \& Agda
\item Apply it to the model of Gintis as presented in \cite{Gintis2006} and specified in the paper "Mathematical specifications for agent-based
models of exchange: a case study" by N. Botta, A. Mandel, M. Hofmann, S. Schupp.
\item Extend the framework to continuous time and implement Continuous Batch Auctions as proposed by Budish et al. in the paper "The High-Frequency Trading Arms Race: Frequent Batch Auctions as a Market Design Response".
\item Use framework to test hypotheses and verify them
\end{enumerate}
