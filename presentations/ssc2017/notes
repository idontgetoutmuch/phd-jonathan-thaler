- bring 5 Messages (as in Sentences) accross which are on the same topic, more people cannot cope with

- need a good starting-story

- not too technical: design talk to explain it to a non-computer science audience
	-> explain concepts of time in computer, agents "perceiving" time,... in a non-technical way
	-> challenge: thread of execution,...

Notes on Content:
- agents are a metaphor (proactive, messaging, environment) but when we actually want to simulate agent-based models we must ask "how can agents be raises to existence in computing environments?". thus we move from a perfect modelling world / perfect theoretical world to the real world thus our task becomes an engineering problem

- pro-activity requires "to be" / existence.  a program is / exists when it is executed. humans differ from programs that they can observe and alter their own execution - they are self concious and have free will
- what is it with 'parallel' universes which are spawned when acting in parallel on the same environment? we need to find a consensus into how to collapse these parallel universes into one onto which to act in the next step

- when references are not allowed and implicit mutable date not available then messaging will always take time. whether this is desiarble depends on your model semantics
