China experience
- coursework
	-> demonstrate
	-> originally too hard
	-> ... then too easy

- exam was no big deal
	-> preparation lecture: showed them basically 2 of the most difficult examples, still many didnt get it right (KVStore)

- teaching was awesome
	-> students nice, respectful, ask many questions per email and after the lecture directly or in the office. they ask until they have understood it 

Property-Based Testing in ABS
- general explanation of cover and checkCoverage in QuickCheck
	-> cover 15 (length xs >= 50) (reverse (reverse xs) == xs)
	-> checkCoverage

- explain event-driven SIR

- agent-specification
	-> input-to-output events
	-> checking of computed coverage

- sir invariants

- comparison of time- and event-driven SIR

- validation against SD implementation
