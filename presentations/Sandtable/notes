- no need for big introduction into ABS but focus more on that there are different ABS according to macal "all you ever wanted to know..." 
	-> direct communication yes / no 
	-> ...

- very basic introduction into FP, take from UNNC

- introduce Zero-Intelligence Gode&Sunder
	-> implementation in python
	-> my implementation in Haskell and Idris
	-> show graphs produce with R

- briefly go through Haskell / Idris implementation
	-> code on slides, explain carefully

- property-based testing

- complex topics
	-> stateful agents (with internal state)
	-> communicating agents
	-> lock-free concurrency in ABS

- conclusions
