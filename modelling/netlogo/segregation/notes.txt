	=> the higher the density, the more tolerance we need?
	
	
neighbor movement-strategy seems to be not working at all

global movement-strategy is extremely powerful
	can deal with very high density TOGETHER with very high similarity wanted
	
	in case there exists no solution (not enough space to perfectly separate)
	it is able to build segregation anyway (but population unhappiness stays at some level)
	
	NEEDS at least a little space, otherwise fails
